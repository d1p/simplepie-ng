			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="  alignnone" title="Wilfred, on FX." src="http://cl.ly/3Q2l3d3Z2K2U0v3w2U3I/r_wilfrg.jpg" alt="Image Credit: Hulu and FX" width="558" height="217" /></p>
<p>When I first started watching <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/wilfred/">Wilfred</a> and, actually, through much of the first season, I really really enjoyed it. It’s just hysterical, wrong, and hilarious.</p>
<p>I’ve never been dumb enough to be a stoner, so that part of the comedy is a little lost on me, but there’s so much more that’s hilarious that <strong>I found myself cracking up the whole time</strong>.</p>
<p>But as the season neared the end, things began to sour.</p>
<p>First of all, Wilfred’s trifling ceases to have a valid point. Initially, each episode was a weird process of self-realization Ryan is forced through by having to deal with Wilfred incessant meddling.</p>
<p><strong>But those epiphanies start to be more questionable around episode 9 or 10, and never make any more sense</strong>.</p>
<p>And beyond that, the lengths to which Wilfred goes to make Ryan’s life miserable and terrible go far beyond the bounds of ANY lesson one might need to learn, let alone weak, unnecessary lessons.</p>
<p>After this are a couple of mild spoilers, just warning you. <strong>Although honestly, a better warning would be to not watch the last few episodes anyway. You’re better off.</strong></p>
<p>In one episode Ryan actually finds an amazing, interesting, attractive woman who is really interested in him. Every sane person in the world wants Ryan to go with her to Italy and leave Wilfred behind. But he doesn’t. Sure, Ryan justifies it somehow, but it makes no sense, even when watching the episode.</p>
<p>Ryan is doggedly (pun) committed to this VERY self-destructive relationship with this dog/person who does nothing but bring him catastrophe after catastrophe.</p>
<p>Then there’s the finale. *sigh*</p>
<p>All season long, the show has been a comedy. A very funny one. But for the finale, the show’s writers decided to make it feel like a John Grisham/J.J. Abrams Mashup gone terribly wrong. It’s heavy and dramatic, and terrible things happen, then you’re given one of those, “Wilfred never really existed at all”-type plot twists and- BAM! credits roll. It’s atrocious.</p>
<p>I can see how it was meant as a cliff-hanger, but a finale like that has me wanting to jump off a cliff or hang myself, and I’m pretty sure that’s not what FX was going for with the term.</p>
<p>And, in the end, after such an awkward ending, whatever answers I wish I had, I’m quite confident will not be given adequately or interestingly by the show’s producers.</p>
<p><strong>I guess it’s a good thing so much awesome TV starts this week!<br />
</strong><br />
What are you most looking forward to being back on the air this fall?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning, I was thinking about how SEO has affected my views of church. Don’t laugh at me.</p>
<p><strong>In a certain way, the church is the king of content marketing.</strong></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 327px"><a href="http://www.jiveturkeyjives.com/?p=4567"><img title=" Jesus is a Mac Guy." src="http://cl.ly/3Y2g0m0f0E3O2J3E1h3W/Screen_shot_2011-09-20_at_2.06.59_AM.JPG" alt="Image Credit: Jive Turkey" width="317" height="251" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Jive Turkey</p></div>
<p>The meat of its products and services (pun) has not changed much in decades, or even centuries. But that hasn’t stopped or even slowed down the machine of christian media from rewriting, re-spinning, redesigning, retargeting, researching, and redeveloping the same content for a constantly shifting set of different audiences.</p>
<p>How drastically different is the best way to live the christian life for the different walks of life?</p>
<p>Seriously. We boil it down to its simplest truth (which we love to do) and it’s what?</p>
<blockquote><p>“Love God. Love People.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And that’s fantastic, really. I get it. Simple, Succinct, Strong. It is the <em>“Consistently Develop Amazing Content”</em> of Christianity. Of course that’s the key to all SEO, but if you leave it there, what’s left to discuss? What content about SEO is left to even develop?</p>
<p>How odd would church services be this weekend if every pastor in America walked to the pulpit (or stool and high table— for the truly relevant), and uttered a four word sermon. “Love God, Love People.”</p>
<p>As a personal aside, I’d say that it would reduce the amount of “thin content” being produced at churches every week that a Parochial Panda would probably pummel. Joel Osteen, I’m looking at you.</p>
<p>So, what are churches to do? Well, I’m not sure. A lot of SEO advice simply eliminates a lot of what you’re doing. <strong>Remove duplicate content. That’s one of the ten commandments of SEO.</strong> Here’s how you might recognize it better:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Avoid vain repetitions.” &#8211; Jesus</p></blockquote>
<p>Why take the same great content, say a fantastic, biblical teaching on good morality, and muddy it up with countless, slightly different versions of itself? A great piece of content will work for almost any age. It’s not necessary to repackage (and in many cases re-sell) the same exact material. But the church loves to make a version ever so slightly altered to “best connect” with a 5/8/10/12/14/16/18/21 yr. old. Oh, and a slightly different version for 20 something, 30 something, 40 something, and 50 plus, then another set for each of those with children. I know a content farm when I see one.</p>
<p>On to User Experience. <strong>Don’t bait and switch.</strong> No gateway pages, that’s a SERP penalty waiting to happen. If I invite my friend to a singles event, he is going to be expecting to be able to chat and hopefully meet a nice girl. He is not expecting to be faced with the question of where he will spend eternity.</p>
<p>It’s getting late, so I’ll end with this kicker.</p>
<h1>The future of search is social.</h1>
<h1>The future of church is social.</h1>
<p>Relationships drive us. To the best content on the web, and to the best our faith has to offer.</p>
<p>We share the videos, blogs, images we like to those around us, so they can enjoy them. Do we not owe the believers around us the same with how to walk out this faith we claim to follow?</p>
<p>I absolutely refuse to use a keyword that doesn’t work. So, “small groups” (which DOES work) is what I guess I’m putting a plug in for.</p>
<p>And I don’t mean just one at your church. I mean the concept. Faith in community. The greatest story ever told, has yet to be told best through advertising or even keyword targeting or anything other then it going viral. People encouraging other people in their faith.</p>
<p><strong>And that’s how christianity should be doing SEO.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Where do I even start?</em></p>
<p>So much has happened.<br />
So much has changed.<br />
Some changes good.<br />
Others not as good.</p>
<p>But wow, change all around.<br />
It really is the only constant.</p>
<p>New job, or new position I should say, is going well so far. It’s my first week, and all the websites are still up, so I consider that a personal win, haha.</p>
<p>I really want to do this well. To own it. To progress the company well and forward.</p>
<h2>Oh, yeah, so <strong>#MozCon was amaze-balls</strong>. Scrumtrellescent. As they say.</h2>
<p>First and foremost, I got to connect well with the owner, my new boss, and develop a good rapport with him. That was great. Secondly, I just learned a crapton of stuff.</p>
<p>The conference was a wonderful range of inspiring higher thought level content, general principles and rules, and specific nerdy tools and tips. My aspirations now range from lofty brand identity and purpose-driven goals all the way to wanting to be a <strong>Distilled Excel Ninja</strong> and also be <strong>Google Analytics Certified.</strong></p>
<p>Also, I totally helped start a mini-flashmob cantab toast to Rand Fishkin at the beginning of his head-to-head with Will Critchlow. Kudos to Greg Gifford for helping it actually happen!</p>
<p>And now, I have a cool title. <strong>Marketing Director.</strong> Pretty Schnazzy I must say.</p>
<p>It’s not really the exact position I’ve imagined myself being in, but then again, not so far off either. I feel like I can thrive here.</p>
<p>In some ways it’s been tough to not try to pursue and date girls more often or, more heartily. But then I look and realize that I haven’t had the time to prioritize that, and that’s ok. I’m glad I called myself out early in the year.</p>
<p>Sadly, I’m not as close to meeting my yearly goals as I would like to be. I’ll get there though.<br />
Like Ali in the Jungle.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I turned 29, and in a strange turn of events, I was way too busy celebrating my birthday to document much of it. </p>
<p>A quick recap of the whirlwind month leading up to my birthday and the present:</p>
<p>I spent a great weekend at the beach with some awesome friends.<br />
I relaxed in a hot tub.<br />
I played three shows in two days.<br />
I went to a good friends wedding, one of the most truly joyful ones I have been to.<br />
I went to St. Augustine to watch the fireworks on the Fourth at the Fort. Tradition maintained.<br />
I saw Transformers in 2D.<br />
I saw Transformers in 3D.<br />
I saw the final space shuttle launch, which really deserves a whole blog post of its own.<br />
I watched Harry Potter Seven part One.<br />
I went to the Atlantic and the Bull (a few times, actually) to see Ricky Kendall, and other awesome people.<br />
I had Hibachi with my parents.<br />
I went to see the midnight premiere of Harry Potter Seven part Two.<br />
I went to a Movie night at Anthem and got to celebrate with those cool people and watch Back to the Future.<br />
I relaxed in a different hot tub.<br />
I played drums for First Assembly, a rare pleasure, rarer still to come.<br />
Finally life has slowed some. Although it is not without plenty of changes all around.</p>
<p><b>I&#8217;m a year older.</b><br />
I feel like I&#8217;ve improved in several ways, but the busyness of summer has plateaued me in a way I am not happy with. Gotta fix that.</p>
<p>Two of my good friends are moving away. </p>
<p><b>J Tony</b>, you&#8217;re the man, man; don&#8217;t give up hope man. Hold fast to integrity and character. They really make you who you are. You&#8217;re gonna make it. I can&#8217;t wait &#8217;til we attend each other&#8217;s weddings.</p>
<p><b>Stauffer</b>. All heroes eventually find their own Gotham, and I&#8217;m sad but excited to see you find yours. I&#8217;m gonna miss you so freaking much. Damn. Remember when you helped me load my drums on the side of a Georgia mountain? Or when you visited Southeastern? Man. Love you man.</p>
<p>What else? Oh, I&#8217;m getting a different roommate&#8211; <b>Britt Daniel</b>. Play your cards right, Britt, and one day you too could me mentioned all too mushily in a blog post much like my friends above. </p>
<p>And my old roommate <b>Shane Welker</b> is moving out. We had some pretty good talks, man. But for real, I&#8217;m sweating, I&#8217;m gonna turn the AC on. Shane&#8217;s moving up too. By a floor and in roommate models. Punny. <b>Noah Marks</b> is as sexy as a model&#8230; of a life that is dedicated to pursuing holiness. We&#8217;ll catch it, man.</p>
<h1>Hope Springs Eternal from Everywhere.</h1>
<p>I got an unofficial promotion at work that comes with an official raise, and starts with a trip to <b>MozCon</b> in Seattle, a conference run by my absolute favorite SEO guys, <b>SEOmoz</b>.</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t think I was gonna NOT mention drumming, did you?<br />
I&#8217;m growing. I need to grow more. And I will. Working on equipment, tuning, and the rudiments. I actually might have a chance to soon to get lessons from my favorite jazz drummer in Gainesville, Jon Jackson. As for a band&#8230; well, I&#8217;m a little too busy getting my crap together to worry much about that. </p>
<p>But when I do, it will rock with soul.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.smartinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/SEOMOZ.png" alt="Roger has a crush on Justin Briggs." /></p>
<p>I just finished watching the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/webinars">SEOmoz</a> PRO webinar on Effective Link Building by <a href="http://twitter.com/justinrbriggs">Justin Briggs</a> of <a href="http://www.distilled.net">Distilled</a>. Here&#8217;s a few notes on it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.seattle24x7.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/justinbriggs.jpg" alt="Justin Briggs" /></p>
<p>I was a bit skeptical of the webinar because I didn&#8217;t want to just hear a rehashing of things I already know. But I definitely was hoping for some advice on recovering from Panda&#8217;s Pummeling Punch®. Although Panda wasn&#8217;t really addressed, <strong>Justin did a fantastic job</strong> of relaying things to build your link profile that I haven&#8217;t already heard before.</p>
<p>The most basic example is the <strong>creative contact mining</strong>. In short, <strong>find really great blogs that don&#8217;t have clear contact information, then hunt down that contact info</strong> to contact him about getting a link on that blog.</p>
<p>Before you start throwing stones at me for being a proponent of cold-call-link-begging, this is only the second half of the process. The process, or, my paraphrasing or what Justin said is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find an awesome page.</li>
<li>See what the page is highlighting or linking to.</li>
<li>Make one of those.</li>
<li>Contact them about a link to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>He even talked about a new paradigm on directory submissions, or one I hadn&#8217;t heard before, anyway. Good stuff.</p>
<p>One great tip&#8230; <strong>Use <a href="http://stumbleupon.com">StumbleUpon</a></strong>. If you get enough thumbs ups, StumbleUpon will post your page to it&#8217;s Facebook and Twitter, spreading your content even more, and building more links to it.</p>
<p>Another great takeaway:</p>
<h1>You <strong>will</strong> have failed content.</h1>
<p>Deal with it. Back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Justin also relayed a great way to recover Failed Infographics as well as this quick and easy blogging contest idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give them email address</li>
<li>They email their post in.</li>
<li>You request a link back to the contest page.</li>
<li>They are usually cool with that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Links and related content in one awesome swoop. <strong>Huzzah!</strong></p>
<p>There was also a whole segment on using Excel to do what amounts to SEO magic for linkbuilding. Much of it was over my head but I plan on trying to wrap my brain around it later. Here&#8217;s the link he shared for getting started with it:<br />

<p>Unfortunately, I missed most of the Q&#038;A session so I plan on hitting it back up when it posts as a video right here:<br />

<p>By far though, my favorite line was this quoted qoute:</p>
<blockquote><h2>&#8220;You can&#8217;t outsource giving a shit.&#8221;</h2>
<p> &#8211; Tom Critchlow</p></blockquote>
<p>This is where your hustle and JFDI attitude can make you a BAMF at linkbuilding.</p>
<p>Who else watched the #Mozinar and what did you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presented by Drew Allen.</p>
<p>Better late than never.</p>
<h2>Album of the Year</h2>
<h1>Kanye West: My Dark and Twisted Fantasy</h1>
<h3>Runner Up: The Roots: How I Got Over</h3>
<p> This was a super tough call. I think that the emotio-moral dichotomy these two albums thematically represent is very reflective of the same dichotomy that existed in my life in 2010.</p>
<h2>Film of the Year</h2>
<h1>Inception</h1>
<h3>Runner Up: Black Swan</h3>
<p>SO many good movies came out this year, but in the end these were such all-encompassing experiences to Behold. The King&#8217;s Speech is definitely just behind these two for me.</p>
<h2>New Artist of the Year</h2>
<h1>Mumford &#038; Sons</h1>
<h3>Runner Up: The Black Keys</h3>
<p>I think this is indicative of the rise of both meaning and groove in my musical tastes this year. Mumford is such a perfect sacred in secular example. Awesome.</p>
<h2>TV Show of the Year</h2>
<h1>Mad Men</h1>
<h3>Runner Up: Community</h3>
<p>Mad Men is a beautiful, dark, character-driven study of a broken man and his struggle to regain a sense of morality, purpose, and identity. Community is a uniquely written, simply hilarious look at a group of misfits learn to like and love each other. Both are amazing.</p>
<h2>Author of the Year</h2>
<h1>Jeff Wilser</h1>
<h3>Runner Up: George Orwell</h3>
<p>Maxims of Manhood was a great example of hilarity colliding with plain, good things that men should hear. And thanks to George, I&#8217;m afraid of my iPad.</p>
<h2>Store of the Year</h2>
<h1>Target</h1>
<h3>Runner Up: Publix</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve made the switch from a generally corrupt and uncaring big box store to a clean and more socially aware one. Plus, there&#8217;s nothing like having your own place to enjoy shopping at Publix all the more.</p>
<h2>Man of the Year</h2>
<h1>Ricky Kendall</h1>
<p>I don&#8217;t really feel the need to say too much here, as his songs speak so much better of him than I can. Authentic, honest, wise passion roaring from his heart, mind, voice and guitar.</p>
<p>Lifetime Achievement Earle:</p>
<h1>George Clooney</h1>
<p>No explanation necessary.</p>

<p>I just got out of another great webinar by <a href="http://randfishkin.com/blog/">Rand Fishkin</a> and the team at <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/">SEOmoz</a> on <strong>The Future of Linkbuilding.</strong></p>
<p>While some of it seemed to be kinda common sense and stuff I&#8217;ve heard before, I definitely walked away with some takeaways I wasn&#8217;t expecting to.</p>
<p>The summary is nothing that most SEO people aren&#8217;t already aware of. </p>
<p>Content is the thing. Organic, Natural Links are the thing. Why spin your wheels on black hat tactics that will only work less and less from here on out? Google is only going to get smarter, and Facebook is already organic and accounting all the time for more and more of search rankings. You should put that same amount of effort you have been on black and gray hat linkbuilding into any one of 34 ways Rand and <a href="http://tomcritchlow.com/">Tom</a> discussed to generate content that people will share, love, and link the crap out of.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not gonna mention all 34, many you could probably guess, and it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/features">PRO</a> webinar anyway, can&#8217;t give it all away for free, right?</p>
<p>But here are a few things I think are worth mentioning:</p>
<p><strong>2. Be a Content Resource in your niche. </strong><br />
Higher Quality > Higher Quantity.</p>
<p><strong>7. Leverage Current events in Content. </strong><br />
This recap I&#8217;m writing right now is an example. </p>
<p><strong>8. Find Amazing Designers. Pay Them.</strong><br />
Look at design boards and galleries for newcomers who are more willing to work for a less premium price than veterean design masters.</p>
<p><strong>11. Build Robust About pages. Use photos if at all possible.</strong><br />
This builds your profile as an actual brand, not just a generic (possibly shady) online company.</p>
<p><strong>13. Earn and display Testimonials and Press Mentions.</strong><br />
Submit yours with link and photo to sites/companies you love and use.</p>
<p><strong>16. Register your business and address at <a href="http://getlisted.org">getlisted.org</a></strong><br />
That site quickly and easily checks and completes your location listing on the major search engines.</p>
<p><strong>18. Earn branded search traffic.</strong><br />
Build your search engine rankings by clicking on <a href="http://www.google.com/?q=drew+allen">this</a> and clicking &#8220;Drew Allen is retiring&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Now you try that with your brand.</p>
<p><strong>22. File patents and/or fund scholarly research. </strong><br />
It costs a little money, but not only does it more robustly protect that web app you developed, but it also gets you link love from some very respectable sources.</p>
<p><strong>24. Get your great design in design portals.</strong><br />
The designer is featured on the design portal, but where are they all visiting to see his (or her) work? Your site.</p>
<p><strong>28. Use sites like <a href="http://followerwonk.com/">followerwonk</a> to make key bloggers, and connectors aware of your brand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>34. Make your RSS feed &#8220;full content&#8221; and include appropriate, absolute links back to your site. </strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty more where that came from. <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/about/team">SEOmoz</a> is awesome. Anyway, I&#8217;ll leave with a quote from Rand at the end about moving towards EARNING links as opposed to begging for them:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not willing to trade short term gains for long term benefits, what you&#8217;re making probably isn&#8217;t worth making&#8221; &#8211; Rand Fishkin</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said.</p>
<p>Anybody else attend? Love it? Hate it? Let&#8217;s hear it.</p>

<p>If social media bores you, don&#8217;t read this. You&#8217;ve been warned.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hubspot.com">Hubspot</a> did a little webinar on 5 tools to Market with Facebook marketing today.</p>
<p>First off, they used <a href="http://www.vcall.com">Vcall</a> to webcast, which is a strike right off. I&#8217;d never heard of them until today. First, it doesn&#8217;t work in Chrome. No good. Second, it crashed Firefox 4 twice, and the audio stuttered throughout. Finally, it slowed all my web traffic down. You may be thinking it&#8217;s my system, but it&#8217;s not. I watch other Hubspot and <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/">SEOmoz</a> webinars regularly with no trouble at all. So, yeah, that&#8217;s a bit of a thumbs down for Vcall.</p>
<p>On to the knowledge. First, it&#8217;s important to note how important Facebook Fans are. They&#8217;re more desirable than Facebook users as a whole. They click links 5 times more often and have over twice as many Facebook friends as users do, on average.</p>
<p>Fans are hardcore Facebook users. Fans are looking for deals, news &#038; community. Engaging your Facebook fans is about building loyalty, growth, and retention among existing customers. They&#8217;re looking for exclusive offers and benefits from being a fan, so that&#8217;s what you need to be offering. </p>
<p>And before you talk about ROI and not wasting social efforts on existing fans, you should know that <strong>36% of fans buy more from your brand after becoming a fan. </strong></p>
<p>And in case you hadn&#8217;t noticed, <strong>you need Like buttons on your site.</strong> No, really. They work. They build brand engagement on your site, and they share your product on facebook to more people which both builds brand awareness AND drives more traffic back to your site. And what&#8217;s the secret that makes that makes Likes far more desirable than Shares?</p>
<p><strong>Likes allow you to target ads to specific fans, which is the most successful form of Facebook ad targeting</strong>. You can offer newer, similar, and discounted versions of a liked product to all of its fans and their friends too. Huzzah. Didn&#8217;t know that before today. Good job, Hubspot.</p>
<p>So, what are people liking more and more? Sadly, it&#8217;s the same thing that makes terrible reality TV popular: <strong>Sex, Arguments, Food.</strong> Seriously, Hubspot compared Facebook to Jersey Shore, which if I were Facebook, I&#8217;d be very offended. Other attendees did point out that the base level topics are probably not wise for strictly B2B Facebook Marketing, which is often seeking a bit higher thought level. God, I hate Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not still using &#8220;Updates&#8221; to inform your fans, are you? Well, then stop. They hardly ever get read. Use wall posts instead. Also, I&#8217;ll let you watch the webinar for the details, but Facebook has an algorithm for &#8220;EdgeRank,&#8221; which is what drives and creates the &#8220;Top News&#8221; Tab. <strong>You definitely need to have at LEAST 1% engagement on a wall post for it to start earning any EdgeRank.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to note some simple facts about Facebook&#8217;s relationship to/with Google. First, <strong>Facebook is growing faster than Google is</strong>. Second, they are different marketing tools that work together and require you to develop different approaches to each. Facebook is demand generation. Your marketing is lifestyle-based and brand-driven. Google is demand fulfillment. This is where you make more direct sales pitches.</p>
<p>And one of my favorite takeaways from the webinar was this little ditty:</p>
<h2>Most FB ads burn out after 3 days!</h2>
<p>Seriously, the CTR drops a LOT after 3-4 days. So, you may want to spend that budget on a 5-day campaign over a 2-week one. Just a thought.</p>
<p>They usually post the video from the webinar about a day or so after, so you probably wanna check here for it:<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time since spring of 2008, I am not actively playing with an active band outside of church. And oddly enough I don&#8217;t really mind. Go figure.</p>
<p>I am home now from playing my last show with Moodhosa. I&#8217;ve been awake for 20 hours now, and i&#8217;m at the point of delerium and falling sleep at the keyboad&#8212; which i have done twice now.</p>
<p>I postponed the kissing booth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really grateful for all the fun times I&#8217;ve had with Moodhosa, and I&#8217;m gonna miss them.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who made it out tonight. The journey continues.</p>
