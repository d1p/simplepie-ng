 <title>Infographic: What&#039;s Really Happening At Solyndra</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784725/infographic-whats-really-happening-at-solyndra?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ve heard bad things about it in the news, but one company&#039;s bankruptcy doesn&#039;t spell doom for the solar industry, or government funding of energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/solyndra-graphic-3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/solyndra/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;amp;sq=solyndra&amp;amp;st=cse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read any news recently&lt;/a&gt;, you&#039;ve heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/tag/solyndra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Solyndra&lt;/a&gt;, the big solar firm whose bankruptcy is causing headaches for the Obama administration and is being used as evidence that the world isn&#039;t ready for solar power. But the administration &lt;a href=&quot;http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/obama-administration-presses-ahead-with-renewable-energy-grants.php?ref=fpblg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is plunging ahead with renewable energy grants&lt;/a&gt;, and when you look at the evidence, it seems that they may be in the right; Solyndra may not prove much of anything besides that the market punishes bad businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://1bog.org/blog/inforgraphic-solyndra-versus-the-solar-industry/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new infographic from solar from One Block Off The Grid&lt;/a&gt; takes a look at what exactly happened to Solyndra, and what it means for the rest of the industry, outside of allowing a lot of people to bloviate. As we&#039;ve written before, Solyndra&#039;s solar panels were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1777470/why-its-not-such-a-bad-thing-that-a-solar-company-with-1-billion-worth-of-investments-went-o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;simply beaten by the market.&lt;/a&gt; Though Solyndra was once beating the average price badly, today, other companies are making their products cheaper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/solyndra-graphic-1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, this means that solar is more accessible. Solyndra&#039;s failure is because solar panels are cheaper and more people have access to them. And what does it say about the government&#039;s grant program? Well, Solyndra did get a large chunk of money from the government (and us taxpayers), and that money is now gone. But it&#039;s a tiny amount of the total money that the government is investing in renewables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/solyndra-graphic-2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And do Solyndra&#039;s failings presage a general failure by the government to invest smartly in renewable energy projects? Is the program&#039;s entire $38.6 billion doomed to be lost like the $535 million given to Solyndra? Barring other unforseen disruptions in the market, the other nine of the top 10 most funded companies are all doing fine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/solyndra-graphic-3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues of any shady emails between the administration and the company aside, Solyndra is an edge case when it comes to the prospects for solar power. The free market rejected Solyndra&#039;s approach--other people can build solar panels cheaper. While the DOE&#039;s grant program officers should, perhaps, have seen that development coming, the Solyndra case doesn&#039;t seem to be part of any trends about the lack of impact of solar power and government funding of renewables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full graphic, which also includes a helpful timeline of Solyndra&#039;s demise, is below, or you can look at it large on 1BOG&#039;s site &lt;a href=&quot;http://1bog.org/blog/inforgraphic-solyndra-versus-the-solar-industry/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

 <title>Apple Pie: The Tastiest Rumors About The iPhone 5 And More [Updated]</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1781564/the-apple-pie-the-tastiest-rumors-about-the-iphone-5-and-more?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As Apple, we assume, gears up for a press event to reveal the iPhone 5--and possibly a handful of other innovations--the rumor mill spins up, and leaks from inside Apple reach the press. Here&#039;s what&#039;s going on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/iphone5-render6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;apple-iphone 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaked Parts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phonearena.com/news/Alleged-next-iPhone-component-shot-reveals-Apple-A5-chip_id22225&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaked parts&lt;/a&gt; purporting to show the partly disassembled guts of an updated iPhone have surfaced online. Key among the components are what looks like an updated A5 Apple-brand ARM CPU and a slightly different battery to the iPhone 4 (helping differentiate the product from very similar earlier components).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/19/iphone-4s-is-likely-an-early-prototype/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Some question&lt;/a&gt; that this device is actually an updated iPhone, citing the oddly retro-looking grille in front of the screen proximity sensor, but others think the general design tallies with what we&#039;re expecting from a new iPhone. Whether they&#039;re from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1765318/iphone-5-details-kinda-sorta-leakand-impress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an iPhone 5&lt;/a&gt; (and whether that version will get an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1740131/iphone-5-rumors-all-metal-wireless-payment-nfc-logins-to-macs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all-metal&lt;/a&gt; back, as per our rendered impression, above) or not is the big question...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/apple-iphone-a5-chipset.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 4S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...with the conclusion being that the device, while possibly a highly polished prototype or in-field testbed, is more likely to be the iPhone 4S--what seems to be the launch name for the long-rumored iPhone &quot;lite.&quot; Most thinking currently has it that the iPhone 5 will be a new design, with a radically different shape (see &quot;Cases&quot; below) and the revamped 4S will break with Apple&#039;s tradition of keeping the previous-gen iPhone on sale at reduced prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;4S&quot; name has shown up in store &lt;a href=&quot;http://macdailynews.com/2011/09/18/att-inventory-system-lists-apple-iphone-4s/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inventories&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the product&#039;s launch, and the JP Morgan posted a high-profile article &lt;a href=&quot;http://business.financialpost.com/2011/09/19/how-apple-could-produce-a-big-bang-for-investors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/19/j-p-morgan-calls-for-two-iphones-entry-level-iphone-4-plus-and-iphone-5-with-cdma-and-gsm-but-not-lte/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;underlined&lt;/a&gt; Apple will be bringing two phone products to its upcoming launch event--not one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re expecting the 4S to be a slightly uprated iPhone 4, with an improved antenna (because other rumors suggest Apple&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://iphone.pandaapp.com/news/09152011/193707051.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ditching&lt;/a&gt; its rubber &quot;bumper&quot; case) and world-phone capabilities thanks to a GSM/CDMA chip from Broadcom. It&#039;ll likely have smaller flash RAM, making it cheaper and maximizing the opportunities offered by iTunes-iCloud&#039;s streaming options, and it&#039;ll hopefully be a lot cheaper off-contract--because Apple&#039;s had well over a year to optimize the production line--and thus aimed at developing markets as well as pre-pay fans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few concrete details have leaked yet about the iPhone 5&#039;s redesign--unsurprising perhaps, because after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1621516/iphone-leak-iphone-4-apple-gizmodo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodogate&lt;/a&gt; and bearing in mind Apple&#039;s hiring security experts, the firm is likely to be keeping the fifth iPhone really close to its chest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far the most believeable description has come from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisismynext.com/2011/04/22/iphone-5-design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ThisIsMyNext&lt;/a&gt;, which has the iPhone 5 in a fatter but much thinner front-to-back chassis, with a tapered profile and a larger screen that approaches the edges of the phone more than in the iPhone 4&#039;s shape. This is the design that an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/the-nine-most-revealing-iphone-5-case-leaks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing number&lt;/a&gt; of &quot;leaked&quot; cases from Eastern manufacturers agrees with--and while it&#039;s not proof positive, these firms were pretty accurate before the launch of the last iPhone and iPad 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/iphone-5-case-with-iphone-4-macytinet-001.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White iPod Touches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping on some theories that Apple&#039;s abolishing the iPod Touch in favor of its low-price iPhone 4S, and also other rumors the iPod Touch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28878&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;would&lt;/a&gt; get a data-only SIM option like the iPad has, recent indications in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/20/more-confirmation-of-white-ipod-touches/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaked info and components&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Apple&#039;s updating the iPod Touch and keeping the design largely the same. There&#039;s proof it&#039;ll come in a white skin for the first time, like the iPhone does, but we may also expect an uptick in its internal power and storage. Other than this gentle tweak, it looks like Apple is paying less R&amp;amp;D time to what is, undeniably, an increasingly less important product in its stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Be Or Not To Be... Or 4S, Or 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation has increased this week about whether Apple will actually stump up one or two new phones when Tim Cook actually steps on stage in at Apple&#039;s Oct. 4 press event. A Wedge Partners analyst &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bgr.com/2011/09/21/wedge-apples-iphone-4s-will-be-only-new-model-to-launch-this-year/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has garnered much attention&lt;/a&gt; with very definite predictions that the only device Apple will reveal will be the &quot;4S,&quot; a device that&#039;s essentially the iPhone 4 with cosmetic tweaks and uprated guts--much as the 3GS succeeded the 3G. The fact that little or no leaks of components or other data about the supposed redesigned iPhone 5 does, to some minds, confirm this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Al Gore &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/09/21/apple-board-member-al-gore-speaking-at-conference-confirms-iphone-5-in-october/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;let slip&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;new iPhones&quot; (quite definitely in the plural) will be released in October, and as an Apple board member he&#039;s definitely a chap to know this fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the record, our money is on two devices--including the tapered-shape iPhone 5. It&#039;s for a couple of reasons, including giving new CEO&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1776338/tim-cook-apple-ceo-auburn-commencement-speech-2010-transcript&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; a big first launch product and the fact that in the weeks before the iPhone 4 arrived we knew precious little about it at all... if it wasn&#039;t for Gizmodogate, we&#039;d have been totally surprised at its launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/iphone5-family1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone 5 render&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Pulls Future Component Manufacturing From Samsung&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110921PD216.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;according to Digitimes&lt;/a&gt;, increased its demand for components from Japanese firms like Toshiba and Elpida Memory--specifically buying quantities of DRAM and NAND flash memory and storage. It&#039;s another move away from Samsung, after earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/27/apple-set-to-shift-from-samsung-to-tsmc-for-a6-chip-production-next-year/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was planning future production runs of its AX line of CPUs for iPhones, Apple TVs, iPod Touches, and iPads to TSMC--representing potentially billions in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung is aggressively pursuing Apple on IP violations in courts around the world, even as Apple wins several court rulings that Samsung is merely cloning its designs, and recently a previous high-ranking Samsung employee &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashgear.com/ex-samsung-exec-admits-ipad-supply-chain-leak-15179954/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that he leaked information about Apple&#039;s iPad to analysts and hedge fund managers before it was launched. Apple is one of Samsung&#039;s largest business-to-business customers, but the relationship seems to have soured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delays&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A latent production line glitch, seemingly involving bubbles forming in the LCD-touchscreen assembly for components rolling off the Wintek line, &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/23/delayed-bubble-defect-on-wintek-panels-could-affect-initial-iphone-5-shipments/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is now reported as delaying&lt;/a&gt; the iPhone 5 slightly, or at least curtailing the number of devices that&#039;ll be available for sales at its launch. Wintek has vigorously denied the rumor, noting all its products are going to ship on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wintek&#039;s response is what gives us confidence here: The firm may be expected to pull a mysterious &quot;no comment&quot; response if it were trying to cover up a real issue with such a high profile supply part for such a high profile customer, also toeing the same PR-control line Apple obeys. But we also know Apple&#039;s had issues with screens before--including an initially worrying, but later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/iphone-4s-yellow-spot-issue-goes-away-with-a-bit-of-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inconsequential&lt;/a&gt; &quot;yellowing&quot; problem with iPhone 4 screens. It&#039;s hard to say how badly production may be affected, but it&#039;s plausible that the issue may be less significant this time around, as Apple&#039;s thought to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/19/apples-component-suppliers-showing-strength-on-iphone-5-production-ramp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have engaged&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a wider range of suppliers for this new phone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: More Tunes Please&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/28/itunes-music-store-coming-soon-to-10-new-european-union-countries/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new rumor&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.ekonomia24.pl/artykul/706258%2C723675-Apple-lada-chwila-wystartuje-z-iTunes-Store-w-Polsce.html&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;langpair=auto%7Cen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Apple is imminently about to expand its iTunes Music Store offering to 10 more European nations, including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This will eat into the 12 EU nations that don&#039;t yet sport iTunes Music stores, due to the complex cross-border music licensing issues still prevalent in the Union. The move increases the number of nations offering iTunes music by nearly 50%, which is significant for Apple--and comes mere weeks before the new iPhone is expected to hit, bringing iOS5 and Apple&#039;s cloud music/storage/streaming service iCloud with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Adieu To iPod?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is poised to overhaul its iPod lineup in perhaps the biggest way since the device first arrived on the scene a decade ago. Sources connected to Apple, with knowledge of its plans, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/2011/09/27/apple-may-discontinue-the-ipod-shuffle-and-classic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have hinted to TUAW&lt;/a&gt; that the iPod Classic and the Shuffle will actually be ditched from the product inventory at Apple&#039;s upcoming October 4th iPhone press event. This will leave the iPod Nano as the entry-level device, and the iPod Touch will get a few cosmetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot will be a simplified product list, and every iPod will now have a touchscreen like the iPhone and iPad.&amp;nbsp;This thinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1781750/apple-should-kill-the-ipod&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aligns nicely with some thinking&lt;/a&gt; we&#039;ve done at Fast Company, and could be the first move toward shutting the iPod brand down for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: Apple TV Hits Seven New EU Nations, October 4th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/30/apple-tv-set-to-launch-in-7-new-european-countries-next-tuesday/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;credible rumor&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the Apple TV will be hitting seven new EU nations (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) on October 4th. That timing is interesting, as it aligns with Apple&#039;s press event, and has ignited speculation that Apple is primed to announce new content deals for iTunes in more nations as part of its (presumed) combined iPhone/iOS5/iCloud reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next iPhone In Up To 64GB Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/29/next-iphone-to-likely-come-in-64gb-32gb-and-16gb-capacities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leaks from&lt;/a&gt; inside Apple&#039;s inventory system suggest that the next iPhone will come in three sizes, not the two traditional ones: And rumors say the likely capacities are 16GB, 32GB, and a massive 64GB (matching the SSD on the entry-level MacBook Air). The rumor doesn&#039;t discount that the sizes could be 6GB, 16GB, and 32GB--and iCloud and iTunes Match may be seen as Apple reducing the need for large capacity internal storage. But we do know a prototype iPhone was being tested with 64GB on-board storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No iPhone 5?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is interesting--after an armload of leaks we&#039;ve got some evidence, via Vodafone Germany, that Apple is &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/03/163264gb-iphone-4s-8gb-iphone-4-spotted-on-the-vodafone-germany-online-store/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retaining the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for 2011 and adding an 8GB model (this is its cheaper &quot;lite&quot; edition destined for pre-pay markets)...while the purported iPhone 5 is really the iPhone 4S. Anectodal evidence from elsewhere suggests that the 4S is more or less identical in design, just with uprated internals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you believe this one line of argument, then Apple&#039;s not going to reveal the teardrop iPhone design at all tomorrow. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Jobs To Turn Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot rumor, and one to be expected: Steve Jobs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/10/03/steve_jobs_expected_to_appear_at_apples_iphone_5_event_report.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will turn up&lt;/a&gt; at the event, even if he&#039;s not presenting the keynote presentation himself due to his new role in the company, and speculation about his health. It&#039;s worth noting that Reuters&#039; &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Tim-Cooks-time-to-shine-with-rb-2645727867.html?x=0&amp;amp;.v=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; has hedged the story, saying even if Jobs is a no-show it&#039;s not a &quot;major disappointment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chat about this news with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/kiteaton&quot;&gt;Kit Eaton on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/fastcompany&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For content consumers--which is pretty much all of us--there’s a chance things could actually start to fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a movement underway to shift storage from devices to the cloud. There are a number of reasons for this, but the fundamental driver is the massive growth in both the volume of content we each expect to have at our fingertips and the size of the files that HD videos and RAW photos generate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the enthusiasm from both the technical folks and the marketing folks to herald the coming of the cloud is pretty much a lock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what Amazon has figured out--and is implementing with prescient timing--is that the cloud alone is not enough to solve the blur of data that is swamping our devices and our digital lives.&amp;nbsp;What consumers want is a Curated Cloud, and that&#039;s what the Kindle Fire delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Amazon gets it right, we could be shifting from a hardware-centric world to a new phase in the evolution of the web, where content moves to center stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a price of $199, the new 7-inch device is poised to be THE consumer electronics hit of the holiday season. Amazon&#039;s powerful lead in the e-book business, where it holds a commanding 80% market share, is complemented by the video-streaming service that Amazon has built into its annual $79 Amazon Prime subscription service. &amp;nbsp;Prime video will now give Netflix a serious competitor. As of now, Netflix has the larger collection, claiming 51,000 titles for streaming. Today, Amazon has 11,000 titles. But Netflix is about to lose Starz, which includes Sony and Disney films. And Amazon just announced deals with Fox and CBS. Expect Amazon to move aggressively to land more video content deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each Fire tablet comes with a 30-day free trial to Amazon Prime, giving the Prime Instant Video offering millions of new users to sample the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most interesting is Amazon&#039;s use of the cloud to dramatically change the way the web feels on a modern browser. Amazon has done more than build a new piece of hardware; they’ve added an entirely new entry in to the browser market, named Silk. &amp;nbsp;&quot;We re-factored and rebuilt the browser software stack and now push pieces of the computation into the AWS cloud,&quot; Jeff Bezos said at the launch. &quot;When you use Silk--without thinking about it or doing anything explicit--you&#039;re calling on the raw computational horsepower of Amazon EC2 to accelerate your web browsing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This use of the cloud to move computing from the device to shared servers gives Amazon access to data about user behavior that allows for optimization on the fly. Most wireless connections have a latency of 100 milliseconds, but Amazon&#039;s Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2) claims latency of 5 milliseconds or less to most websites. For example, Amazon points out that delivering the home page of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cnn.com&lt;/a&gt; requires 161 files served from 25 unique domains, representing the complexity of modern websites. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The browser observes aggregate user behavior across a large number of sites,&quot; said&amp;nbsp;Jon Jenkins, the director of software development for Silk. &quot;For instance, we might notice that people who view the New York Times homepage, often go to the New York Times business page afterwards. Our browser is capable of detecting these aggregate user behavior patterns and actually requesting the next page you&#039;re likely to need before you even know you need it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Amazon, this moment is the coming together of their three most powerful corporate assets. Their Amazon Web Services infrastructure, know as AWS, has a low profile among all but serious tech geeks, but is reportedly the single largest provider of cloud computing services. Amazon&#039;s content business is both large and diverse, including books, movies, music, and publications. &amp;nbsp;And in the e-reader business, Amazon is the clear leader with 52% of the market, with Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&#039;s Nook commanding just 21%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web services. Content. Devices. This is the perfect triangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By connecting these services, and using the Silk browser to both improve performance and gather user insights, Amazon is in a unique position to deliver a truly unique consumer experience. And because Amazon will control both the operating system (a unique flavor of Android) and the browser (Silk), Fire will do more than access the cloud or leverage cloud resources; it will provide both the intelligence and the interface to access the Curated Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine turning on your Kindle Fire to find the music from your collection, the books you’ve read, the magazines you’ve subscribed to, and the websites you browse on a regular basis pre-loaded on your device. Not the whole web, but your web. Not the big noisy Cloud, &amp;nbsp;but your Cloud content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook now has 140 billion photographs stored; that’s too many to browse. Watching all the video posted on YouTube today would take you eight years--and that’s just today. Twitter has 10 billion tweets. &amp;nbsp;If the cloud is an unfiltered warehouse of content, it’s a big warehouse filled to the rafters with exabytes of undistinguished data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers don’t want more content, they want less. They want their content, stored and served coherently and contextually. And that’s the Curated Cloud that Amazon is promising to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s a cloud worth waiting till November 15th for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more leadership coverage, follow us on &lt;a href=&quot; https://twitter.com/#!/FastCoLeaders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/today/fastcompany.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: Courtesy Amazon]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>&quot;Pay For Performance&quot; Doesn&#039;t Work For Generation Y</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1783489/pay-for-performance-generation-y-pay-compensation-asking-for-a-raise?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Many money-motivated Millennials (and they do exist) will bolt to new opportunities as soon as the great recession of 2007-20?? eases up...unless you happen to be an organization that recognizes their potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; margin: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/money-275.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;275&quot; height=&quot;309&quot; /&gt;Although they are often said to eschew monetary rewards, and have a great eagerness for rewards outside the monetary pay scale, many Millennials find their financial reality daunting. &lt;/p&gt;



Many Millennials are operating under crushing debt: Most college students graduate with close to $20,000 in student loan debt. Graduate and professional students easily can incur $100,000 in loans that have to be repaid as of day one on the job. These knowledge economy workers have made a great investment in higher education, where costs have multiplied by triple digits at both private and public colleges in the last decade and a half. And they&#039;re still escalating.

Millennials now entering the workplace earn less than previous generations. Most workers&#039; real wages have been stagnant since the turn of the twenty-first century, and the gap between productivity growth and workers&#039; wages is at a historically high level. The inflation-adjusted earnings of new college grads have fallen dramatically.

Millennials&#039; entry into the workforce has coincided with rapid increases in key living costs. Education, housing, and healthcare costs have increased rapidly over the last decade. Rents have gone up 50 percent in major metropolitan areas in the last ten years. Even with home prices falling in many regions as a result of the mortgage crisis, median home prices have skyrocketed in geographically appealing areas across the country, severely limiting affordability for first-time buyers. 

Millennials are paying more into Social Security than they pay in income taxes, even though most expect Social Security to be dried up long before they reach retirement age.


&lt;p&gt; It&#039;s clear from these numbers that many Millennials are under increasing financial stress. Consequently, salary will be very important to them. In fact, while Boomers are more likely to want to be paid through a combination of salary and long-term savings and retirement options, Millennials generally tend to prefer to receive immediate compensation for their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the drastic economic reversals they&#039;ve seen in the business world, Millennials are cautious, thinking that neither they nor their organizations will be around long enough to reap the rewards of a pension plan or long-term savings options. They want a check and portable 401(k) match to make their own retirement and investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does Millennial financial stress play out in real dollar terms in today&#039;s workplace? Let&#039;s take a look at determining salary basics. The questions are: What&#039;s a job worth to you? And what are you worth to your potential employer? The first thing to do is understand your organization&#039;s total compensation system, including its compensation philosophy--pay for performance or pay for potential, discussed below--and its attitude toward incentives and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Compensation Philosophy: Pay For Performance Vs. Pay For Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay for performance is the compensation system the Boomers typically use to set and increase pay. It&#039;s what most of us who&#039;ve been working for a while are used to: salaries increase slowly and steadily the more you work, and we do mean slowly--the average salary increase is 3 percent annually. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Pay for Performance Doesn&#039;t Work: The Merit Increase Matrix Game&lt;/strong&gt;
Ever wonder on what basis your salary increases (or doesn&#039;t increase) over time? How decisions are made about your pay? Has your company said they pay you for your performance? Or that they reward for results? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the way it really works in many companies today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, let&#039;s address performance&lt;/strong&gt;. Your organization may have a rating system to determine if you are meeting expectations: good, great, fantastic, wonderful, outstanding, walking on water--or not meeting expectations: needing improvement, one foot out the door, they wish you were gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how the rating scale is presented, here are the basics: 80 percent of employees are rated as doing okay, being cool, getting it done. Forget the labels of good to great; in truth, only 10 to 15 percent of you will be in the &quot;star&quot; category, and 5 to 10 percent may be in the &quot;cull the herd&quot; (get &#039;em out the door) category. The 80 percent of you in the middle are often divided into three or four categories that are shades of gray in which the distinctions of why you are pretty good, good, or really good are very hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now let&#039;s tie that to your pay increase&lt;/strong&gt;. Your organization has only so much money that management wants to spend on pay increases. This is called a salary increase or merit increase budget. Their job is to figure out how to lay that money on you and all of your colleagues. In their search for a solution, they develop a table that will tell your bosses what they are allowed to give you if you meet certain performance standards, measured on an organization-wide rating scale. This is referred to as a salary increase or merit increase matrix, or guide chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chart quantifies your performance level and sometimes your length of service with the organization and/or your position in a salary range, and gives salary increase guidelines to your manager. It is linked to the increase budget, which for the past twenty years has been 4 percent (plus or minus 2 percent, depending on the year). During the past two years, it has been down around 2 percent (for those organizations that actually gave increases), and in the great boom of the late 1990s was as high as 5 to 6 percent in certain industries and for hard-to-find positions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Assuming 4 percent as a budget, here is the typical merit increase matrix for a company:&lt;/p&gt;




PERFORMANCE DESCRIPTION %COMMENTS


Phenomenal6%Walks on water--10 percent of you
Fantastic5%A star in the making--10 percent of you
You Rock3 %A little extra effort, and you too can be a star--10 percent of you.
Not!0%Okay, you&#039;re gone--5 percent of you




&lt;p&gt;That middle group--Fantastic, You Rock, and You Almost Rock--makes up 80 percent of the population of your organization. With a 1 percent difference in your salary increase between the categories, let&#039;s do the math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay for performance=a six-pack of beer.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are making what the average worker makes ($47,569.60 per year, a 1 percent difference in your pay is $475.70 per year, $18.30 gross per pay period (if you have twenty-six pay periods per year), and about $12.81 net per pay period after Social Security, Medicare, and federal, state, and other taxes. That&#039;s about $6.40 per week. And according to our research, that&#039;s what you&#039;d pay for a six-pack of beer. Or--if you are lucky, and you are bumped up a level--two six-packs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&#039;t really believe that this nominal differentiation in pay is motivational and drives performance results. It doesn&#039;t. In fact, it may aggravate working relationships for folks who believe that their performance really matters in determining their future value and find that where the rubber meets the road--their pay--it makes no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Pay for Potential Does Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pay for potential&quot; is a compensation philosophy that tries to level the playing field based on what each employee brings to the job and how well he leverages those competencies. It&#039;s a new concept that gets rid of &quot;the more years you work, the more money you should make&quot; mentality, and recognizes individual talent and potential. While it is challenging for the Boomers to accept a new way of thinking about compensation, pay for potential is far and away the best plan to connect and engage with Millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you&#039;ve been writing computer programs since you were twelve and have a few video games that you&#039;ve created as well. Why are you being paid less than a person who has ten fewer years of real-world experience than you do even if you are younger? Because your talent and potential do not count in the twentieth-century workplace until you demonstrate them through performance. If your organization has moved into the twenty-first century and believes in pay for potential--rewarding you for the skills and competencies you bring in and how those unique assets get manifested in your work regardless of your age or years of workplace experience--then your salary may actually reflect your true gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to assess and integrate pay for potential is by using a &quot;nine box system,&quot; which allows organizations to blend the best of both pay philosophies. With potential rated low to high on an X axis and performance rated low to high on a Y axis, it shows steady performers, potential stars, and rock stars as categories of potential. Potential is assessed in terms of &quot;how high&quot; (next level, top management, etc.) and &quot;how soon&quot; (readiness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, imagine that you are an entry-level whiz kid--all the potential in the world, but still developing. Traditional salary increase programs in most companies will make you earn your spurs in time spent on the job before you start racking up the big bucks. Why? It&#039;s a way that compensation planners &quot;manage&quot; your expectations and keep you in line. And opportunities for promotion are limited since many companies suffer from middle-management malaise, having eliminated these positions in cost-cutting measures (or in response to a fading management fad du jour known as &quot;increased span of control&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is frustrating. It is why many money-motivated Millennials (and they do exist) will bolt to new opportunities as soon as the great recession of 2007-20?? eases up. Unless you happen to be in one of those organizations that recognizes your potential. What these companies have done is break the mold. They will accelerate your compensation not just based on your performance but on what you bring to the table, namely, an asset they want to secure for the long-run. It may be your intellect, your inventiveness, your ingenuity, your incessant drive. But they love you and want to keep you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, your performance is the only driver of pay. In a nine-box system that recognizes multiple dimensions (see diagram below), the actual increases will be higher for those with comparable performance whose potential is far superior.&lt;/p&gt;





% INCREASEPOTENTIAL
PERFORMANCEGOODGREATROCK STAR
Superior61015
Exceeds4610
Meets246

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &quot;good&quot; potential performer could expect to receive merit increases of 2-6 percent based on &quot;traditional&quot; pay-for-performance programs. This is about the limit in most old-school compensation systems. Not Exciting? But, in this example, under a pay-for-potential system, the rock star with superior performance could receive a 15 percent increase. This is epic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a company that innovates in its approach to compensation--that is, it recognizes and accelerates pay for those whose potential exceeds their age--and you may decide to stay for a while!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Getting The Salary You Want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can develop an idea of what you should be getting paid, you need to do some market research. These three sites will give you an idea of what a person in your region, in your industry, and with your job title might make:&lt;/p&gt;


 www.Salary.com (A great site, although pay scales tend to be high.)

 www.PayScale.com (A dynamic site that relies on people submitting their own job profiles and salary data.)
 
www.Glassdoor.com (A snarky website for dishing the 411 on companies, that also provides compensation information.)



&lt;p&gt;You should also understand that all components of pay are negotiable and that you are the chief negotiator. Think of it as free agency. How do you think A-Rod got his record-breaking salary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go into a job interview and you&#039;re asked what salary range you have in mind, do not answer. Ask nicely to defer the answer until you&#039;ve discussed the job a bit more. Let the interviewer suggest a figure. Nod wisely. Do not snap at that lure like a hungry bass. Tell the interviewer your research has shown the range for the job to be whatever it is, and that you believe your experience qualifies you to come in at the top of that range. You won&#039;t get it, but you&#039;ll probably get a counteroffer somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you&#039;re already parked in a cube, wondering whether you can sleep there if your paycheck doesn&#039;t cover the rent. Do you believe your work is worth more money than you&#039;re making? If so, you&#039;ve got company. According to a recent www.Salary.com survey, of 7,141 individuals and 363 human resource or other company representatives, 65 percent of respondents said they&#039;re looking for a new job within the next three months. Fifty-six percent of those say they&#039;re looking because they believe they are underpaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, do the market research on comparable jobs in your region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the HR department may have a regional salary range book. Ask if you can see this; it will be more accurate regarding what employees in your region make than the employer surveys conducted by the big websites-- such as the ones mentioned above. Bigger organizations and public entities publish their pay ranges for all jobs. Ask!&lt;/p&gt;

FUSE TIP
&lt;p&gt;Open the curtain on pay practices. Suspicious minds are quick to distrust their leaders when pay information is kept secret. Being transparent will pay off, provided you administer your pay plans with consistency. Take the mystery out of the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Assessing a Compensation Package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you begin mulling over the total value of an employer&#039;s compensation package, start by figuring out the organization&#039;s compensation philosophy. Do they want to motivate you to perform, or just pay you for showing up? Or are they trying to get you to work your buns off for as cheap as they can get away with, knowing that right before you leave, you&#039;ll sound off about pay and they can adjust your salary a little then? Know their MO (modus operandi)--before and after you join them. Once you&#039;ve assessed the compensation dynamic, move on to the following areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/fuse-cover.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Fuse book cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying the Bills&lt;/strong&gt;
How much do they offer you for the basics--showing up, doing your job, producing some results? This is your base salary. The HR department will spend a lot of time comparing your job to other jobs and trying to figure out what you are worth in the marketplace. The truth is, there is a lot of variability in the market depending on location, supply and demand, and the skill set required. The more skills you have, the more you should get paid. But pay is an art form--not a science. Translation? You have plenty of room to negotiate--if you are good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand that your initial base salary is what all your future raises and salaries will key off of. Pay attention to this, as the money you earn--lifetime earnings, Social Security payouts, and benefits, including retirement contributions--is cumulative. Throughout your working years, you&#039;ve got to keep leveraging your salary, moving it up at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;&gt;Pay Raises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compensation experts will tell you that pay raises depend on&lt;/p&gt;
Your industry
The market and market pay for your job in your region
The pay practices of your organization 
Your performance on the job

&lt;p&gt;All of that is true. What is also true is that there are some cheats--just as in any game--to help you get raises faster. Here are some:&lt;/p&gt;Know how your organization makes money. Whatever else you do, align your work with some part of that process.

Document how your contributions support the goals of your organization. Literally show the people around you how you add value. It pays to connect the dots for busy managers who ultimately have to compare you to your coworkers and dole out the raise budget accordingly.

Be aware of company policy regarding compensation. Some companies are limited by budget constraints, or can only give raises at certain times of the year.

Have a clear idea of what you want if you ask for a raise. Determine the salary range you&#039;re looking for and have a justification for the increase before you make the request.

Be flexible. How about accepting an extra week of vacation instead of a raise? Or a leave of absence to work for a cause that means a lot to you? Or time to work on a new project you&#039;ve devised in your own organization?


&lt;p&gt;Whether your organization&#039;s philosophy is pay for performance or pay for potential, the considerations we&#039;ve outlined here all apply: researching salaries and asking for, assessing, and getting what you want. You can find plenty of help online to research compensation and hone your skills. Maximize your baseline salary, and understand that nonmonetary compensation is often as valuable as salary, especially if it involves time off. Most of all, understand that compensation is usually negotiable, and state your case!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reprinted with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fuse-Making-Sense-Cogenerational-Workplace/dp/1608321460&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fuse: Making Sense of the New Cogenerational Workplace&lt;/a&gt;™ by Jim Finkelstein, Greenleaf Book Group Press.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more leadership coverage, follow us on &lt;a href=&quot; https://twitter.com/#!/FastCoLeaders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/today/fastcompany.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericcommando/5310249253/sizes/z/in/photostream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ericcommando89&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Triggering Demand: How Coffee-Maker Nespresso Turned Drips Into Gushers</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1781304/triggering-demand-how-coffee-maker-nespresso-turned-drips-into-gushers?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/610-nespresso.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nespresso, the product that lets you brew the perfect cup of espresso at home, has made parent company Nestle the leading seller of coffee in Europe. But that success was a long time brewing. Nestle bought the basic design for a single-serve espresso machine in 1974 and introduced a machine in the 1980s. By the late 1990s, the business was still touch-and-go. Today, though, Nespresso enjoys revenues of $3 billion and 10 million Nespresso Club members. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What took it so long to succeed? The biggest problem was simply getting customers to try the &quot;Armani of coffee,&quot; as former Nespresso CEO, Henk Kwakman, once described his kitchen appliance. Without some sort of a trigger--an event that spurs people to take action--consumer inertia rules the day. To convert potential demand into real demand, Nespresso needed the right triggers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Taking the helm in 1997, CEO Kwakman made finding them his priority.  First, he switched from print advertising to TV: When the elegance of the Nespresso machine was demonstrated rather than merely described, demand increased several-fold. Next, he expanded a pilot program offering Nespresso to first-class airline passengers. By 2000, some 1,100 planes flown by 20 different airlines were using the machines, and 3.5 million travelers a year had a chance to sample the product. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But sipping espresso prepared by an attendant was not the same as preparing a cup yourself. So Nespresso worked diligently with retailers to encourage in-store testing. Retailer surveys revealed that stores providing customer trials of the machines and tasting the coffee generated six times as many sales as those merely demonstrating the machines. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Taking a page from the playbook of high-end cosmetics manufacturers, Nespresso marketers approached department stores with a proposition: &quot;Give us 20 square meters and we&#039;ll create a Nespresso store-within-a-store, with our own host and hostess.&quot; The famous Galeries Lafayette in Paris was the first department store to accept the offer; sales of Nespresso machines at the store rose from 50 per year to 700. Soon major retail chains all over Europe were asking for Nespresso shops. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nespresso&#039;s in-store success led to an even more audacious demand-creation strategy--the launch of a chain of Nespresso retail stores. Today, more than 200 gleaming Nespresso boutiques thrive in cities such as Zurich, Milan, London, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, and New York. On busy mornings, the original Nespresso store on the Champs-Elysees in Paris has lines around the block--just as Apple stores do when a hot new device goes on sale. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With the boutiques, the Nespresso sales curve took a sharp tilt upward--28% in 2001, then 34%, 37%, 42%--again, not unlike the super success of Apple stores. Today, fully 60% of Nespresso employees work in direct contact with consumers, providing the company with an invaluable stream of customer feedback. Many casual observers attribute Newspresso&#039;s success to its advertising with actor George Clooney, but that campaign was launched in 2006, following the growth sparked by trial at boutiques. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Nespresso is now Nestle&#039;s fastest-growing brand, with annual growth better than 30% per annum from 2005-2010. Nespresso outsells rival Lavazza in Italy, &quot;the cradle of espresso,&quot; and sells more servings of coffee every year than Starbucks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With the demand triggers firing well, Nespresso continues its boutique expansion under current CEO Richard Girardot, with plans for 250 boutiques by the end of 2011. Meanwhile, the focus has shifted to coffee, to ensure its customers get a &quot;tango on the tongue&quot; with every brew. Girardot spends much of his time traveling the world in search of the very best coffee farms to source inputs for Nespresso&#039;s dedicated pod factory in Switzerland. &quot;We have built relationships with 40,000 farmers,&quot; says Girardot, &quot;and are always looking for more.&quot; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the would-be demand creator, figuring out what kind of trigger will convert fence sitters into customers is not about reasoning from a priori logic or even from the evidence of other businesses. &quot;When you pioneer something new in a market, there is no example, there is no roadmap, so that key thing is that you have to try,&quot; says Kwakman. &quot;Nobody knows what will happen, so the more you try, the more you discover, the faster you learn, the faster you go.&quot;

 <title>How To Read The Link-Crazy Web Without Going Insane</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784198/tools-for-doing-actual-reading-in-a-link-clicking-world?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Feel like your attention span operates at an inverse rate to your broadband speed? Here&#039;s how you can give the good stuff on the web the attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/reading-tips.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of long-form reading you can do right now, on your computer or mobile phone, at the speed of a Google search, involves animated advertisements, multi-page articles smooshed into strange margins, and lots of attention-grabbing links to outside material. The kind of reading you want to do gives the material undivided attention, puts you in touch with your thoughts, and is much easier on your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, thankfully, tools to bridge the divide between the gratification of the web and the illumination of actual reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strip down and simplify your text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inconvenience and distraction of web reading has been addressed by a few different web geeks and entrepreneurs in a mostly similar fashion. If you don’t mind reading on a screen, but want that screen far less cluttered, these are the tools to turn to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instapaper.com&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; The king of clean text and convenience. First you drag &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1697767/innovation-agents-marco-arment-founder-instapaper&quot;&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s “Read Later” tool into your browser’s favorites/bookmarks collection. Then, whenever you see an article you want to read click the button. This will save your stories at the Instapaper website (which requires registration), and allow it be to read anytime via an iPhone or iPad app, or on your Kindle. One tip: view the article in&amp;nbsp;a single page or printer-friendly version before you tap the Read Later button.&amp;nbsp;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readability.com/&quot;&gt;Readability&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; As a pure text-and-images reading tool, Readability does a good job, and it’s easy to install on most browsers. To read articles later, though, and feel better about stripping out advertising, Readability asks for a minimum of $5 per month from readers, which it’s trying as hard as it can to send to great content creators--publications, bloggers, whomever. If you’re using the latest version of Safari, some of Readability’s features are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readability.com/articles/k3jbfq0i&quot;&gt;built into a new “Reader” mode&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://readitlaterlist.com/&quot;&gt;Read It Later&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; A simple app that lets you do what it says, on nearly any device you have with a screen.

&lt;p&gt;Send good reads right to your Kindle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got a Kindle? Thinking about getting one of those sleek new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1783474/amazons-kindle-fire-tablet-just-works-because-its-optimized-to-the-max&quot;&gt;Kindle Fire&lt;/a&gt; tablets? Do some quality reading on your thin little screen, both hand-picked and expertly curated. &lt;a href=&quot;http://delivereads.com/&quot;&gt;Delivereads&lt;/a&gt; takes compelling content from around the web and pushes it wirelessly to your Kindle, with no effort on your part. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinderizer.com/&quot;&gt;Tinderizer&lt;/a&gt; makes it a one-click process to send web articles to your Kindle, where email and Wikipedia and Twitter won’t be able to find you for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have your computer read any text out loud to you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer-generated voices have improved, to the point where only the occasional five-dollar word or proper name gets a bit mangled. If you’ve got an article you want to get through, but just don’t have time not to double-task, enlist your headphones or computer speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Mac, you can open up System Preferences, hit the Speech section, and look in the “Text to Speech” tab. There’s a box there to “Speak selected text when the key is pressed,” which you should tick on, and then a “Set key” button, where you choose the keyboard combo you want to start reading what you see on your screen. Windows users can either dig into their “Ease of Access” settings in the Control Panel, or try an app like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cross-plus-a.com/balabolka.htm&quot;&gt;Balabolka&lt;/a&gt;. Both apps work best after your web reading has been run through one of the cruft strippers mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed up your audiobooks (or any spoken word files)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your literary-minded friends think that audiobooks aren’t really reading, they’re really going to flip when they hear that you’ve been clipping through books at nearly twice the standard speed. It’s easy, but not quite obvious, to change the playback speed &lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/collaboration/quick-tip-speed-listen-to-podcasts-on-your-iphoneipod&quot;&gt;on any file on any iPhone, iPod, iPad&lt;/a&gt;, or in Windows Media Player. On Android phones, both the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://market.android.com/details?id=com.audible.application&amp;amp;feature=search_result&quot;&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt; app, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://market.android.com/details?id=com.aocate.osplay&amp;amp;feature=search_result&quot;&gt;Osplay&lt;/a&gt; let you cut faster through your self-imposed reading list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/2179922218/&quot;&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; on Flickr]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/kevinpurdy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@KevinPurdy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/FastCompany&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;@FastCompany&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Smart Glass Becomes More Or Less Transparent Depending On The Weather</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784221/smart-glass-grows-clear-when-cold-and-dark-when-warm-saving-heating-and-cooling-costs?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows that automatically change color to reduce heating and cooling bills are the next step of smart buildings. South Korean scientists just got a lot closer to automating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/800px-LouvreRoofWindow.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a third of the energy consumed by buildings goes out the window. So efforts to reduce energy use in homes and offices have naturally focused on windows, with varying success. While there are all kinds of smart glass--from &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/190931/electrochromic-glass-instant-darkening&quot;&gt;electrochromic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smartglassinternational.com/technical/spd-smartglass/&quot;&gt;suspended particle displays&lt;/a&gt;--many are expensive, degrade after relatively short periods, or present environmental problems during manufacturing processes. Many U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=25989&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; and research &lt;a href=&quot;http://windows.lbl.gov/&quot;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; are trying to better these early designs. But one of the most promising pieces of research now comes via South Korea, where a group of researchers say they have developed a simple, inexpensive system with minimal environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/windowsmart.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other smart windows, their proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/stoken/presspac/presspac/full/10.1021/nn202328y&quot;&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; becomes more or less transparent according to the light outside, darkening to save air conditioning bills on hot days, and letting in warmth on cold days to reduce heating costs. But unlike other designs, it does so automatically, without users having to use a control to dim or brighten the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/journal/ancac3&quot;&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers claim that by using a polymer, &quot;counterions&quot; (ions with an opposite charge to the substance they associated with) and methanol in layers inside the pane, they can create a low-cost, stable window with extreme switching ability. The glass turns from completely clear to completely opaque in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To our knowledge, such extreme optical switching behavior is unprecedented among established smart windows,&quot; they say. &quot;This type of light control system may provide a new option for saving on heating, cooling and lighting costs through managing the light transmitted into the interior of the house.&quot; And it doesn&#039;t hurt that smart windows will probably impress your friends, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LouvreRoofWindow.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>In Florida, Ranchers Make Room For The Big Cats Who Want To Eat Their Cattle </title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784639/in-florida-ranchers-and-the-big-cats-who-eat-their-cattle-working-to-live-together?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/florida-panther-main.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;panther&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panthers are back. Florida&#039;s still-imperiled big cat--one of the largest in the country--has bounced back from just 20 individuals to more than 160 during the last 30 years. But it&#039;s now in danger of suffering from its own (modest) success. Southwest Florida cattle ranches, spread over tens of thousands of acres of prime panther habitat, are reporting deaths of calves and livestock. Even big cats think cows are delicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But instead of the backlash that followed the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park leading to today&#039;s hunting season (after stripping them of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2011/2011-05-05-02.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Endangered Species Act status in the Northern Rocky states&lt;/a&gt;) and rhetorical battles between Washington and Western states, cattlemen and conservationists are cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Florida cattle ranchers understand that a balance needs to be reached between protecting endangered panthers and addressing the financial impacts of losing calves to panther predation,&quot; said Russell Priddy, owner of the 9,000-acre &lt;a href=&quot;http://swflorida.blogspot.com/2011/09/panther-conservation-issues-addressed.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JB Ranch near the Big Cypress National Preserve&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;We will do our part, and we are expecting that the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission will be responsive to our situation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big cats are ranging as close to Miami as Everglades National Park, as seen on this video from a camera in one of the State&#039;s water 
management districts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[youtube 2o_s3xcFuTw]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the cats are going to increasingly interact with humans and livestock, and those interactions are going to need to be managed. A human death from a panther will hopefully never happen. For the cattle that meet an unforunate demise, there is a $25,000 fund is being proposed by the FWC and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to compensate ranchers. And the University of Florida&#039;s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences will conduct research this fall on the panther&#039;s impact on cattle ranching. So far, though, all parties are working together to make panther reintroduction work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, it could lead to a better example for the reintroduction of major predators in their former habitat critical to the health of larger ecosystems across the U.S., and the world, according to recent studies. With still-endangered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fws.gov/midwest/wolf/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gray wolves&lt;/a&gt; roaming from Wyoming to the Great Lakes region, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5917-2004Dec16_2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mountain lions&lt;/a&gt; repopulating the East, and a pioneering if threatened population of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/mexicanwolf/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mexican wolves&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico, small outposts of carnivores coexisting with humans on the continent they once dominated is a good sign for both species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Everglades_National_Park_Florida_Panther.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Facebook&#039;s New Tools Give Marketers Insights, Help Measure Fans&#039; Word Of Mouth</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784586/new-facebook-tools-help-marketers-measure-fans-word-of-mouth?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the tools Facebook is releasing today in conjunction with New York&#039;s annual Advertising Week are a new dashboard to measure the reach of individual Page posts, an API to allow third-party agencies build their own tools on top of this new Facebook data, and a new ad unit that allows companies to create ads out of their Page posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/WordOfMouth-620.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies set up Facebook Pages to market themselves. But until now, they’ve only had fairly blunt instruments--like the number of Likes--to measure how well they’re doing. Now Facebook is releasing a new set of tools that the social network says will give marketers better insights into how well their Pages are reaching Facebook users--and ultimately make those Pages more useful to brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the tools Facebook is releasing today in conjunction with New York&#039;s annual Advertising Week are a new dashboard to measure the reach of individual Page posts, an API to allow third-party agencies build their own tools on top of this new Facebook data, and a new ad unit that allows companies to create ads out of their Page posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools reflect the company’s increasing emphasis on driving sharing among users--an area of focus CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1765371/zuckerberg-facebook-not-worried-about-google-plus&quot;&gt;announced this summer&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the company now views the amount that people share on Facebook as a stronger indication of the value of the network than the previous metric, which simply measured the total number of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the new Page Insights, Facebook is emphasizing the importance of sharing on Pages, because this increases a brand’s reach,” the company said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/FBInsights-400.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The new dashboard, called Insights (pictured, right), appears as a tab on the company&#039;s Page and is only available to adminstrators of the Page. The Insights tab lists the Page’s total number of fans (&quot;Total Likes&quot;) and the total number of other people reached via those fans (&quot;Friends of Fans&quot;). It also offers a ticker to show whether those numbers are going up or down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Insights tab, Facebook is launching a new metric: “People Talking About This,” which doesn’t just measure how much people are talking about the Page in the conventional sense (such as a user commenting on a post on the brand’s Page). It also includes all the activities that Facebook considers a “conversation”--things that indicate a user is in some way engaged with the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the activities that fall under that the umbrella of a “conversation” are: Liking the Page; posting to the Page’s Wall; liking, sharing, or commenting on a post; RSVP’ing to an event; photo-tagging the Page; checking in at the brand’s Place; and Liking or sharing a check-in deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook says providing this data, particularly at the individual post level, will allow companies to measure the impact of their posts and, ultimately, help them create posts that do a better job of going viral. “Research shows that word-of-mouth conversations among friends are the most influential for getting a brand’s message across,” the company said in its press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Facebook cited comScore research showing that fans and friends-of-fans of a Page are more likely to “visit a store, website, and even purchase a product or service.” Fans and friends-of-fans of Starbucks spend 8% more in stores than the average Starbucks customer and transact 11% more frequently, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data supports Facebook’s overall premise: that the social network is a valuable place to market, because it allows companies to activate user word-of-mouth at a scale previously never possible. Indeed, the company has previously said that Sponsored Stories, a category of ads that show Facebook users which of their friends already Like a certain brand, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1767275/facebooks-sponsored-performing-twice-as-well-as-standard-ads&quot;&gt;perform twice as well&lt;/a&gt; in engaging users than do generic ads on the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/FB-AdUnit-Post.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;To that end, Facebook is also today releasing a new premium ad unit that allows brands to turn their posts into ads. If the ad is put in front of a user who has a friend who is a fan of the brand, the ad will include that information in the ad (pictured at the top of the image, right)--thus, Facebook says, “combining the brand&#039;s voice in the ad with a friend’s voice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the social network, this kind of “social context” results in a 68% increase in people recalling the ad, and people who view these kinds of ads are four times more likely to make a purchase than people who see generic ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, today, Facebook is releasing a “Page Insights API” for outside agencies and developers at brands that have access to certain kinds of (anonymized) Facebook data. The agencies, including Context Optional, Wildfire, and Webtrends, are part of a growing ecosystem of third parties that are building powerful tools for marketers using Facebook data, further accelerating the value that brands get from running campaigns on the social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The updates will enable marketers to discover which publishing and ad strategies on Facebook are creating the most engagement and growth,” Context Optional said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Images: Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcook262/3725563305/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;mooks262&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.B.

Scam apps and links are plentiful on Facebook, but with Websense taking a first look, users will be warned about websites carrying malware before they click on links leading to them.

A federal court, late on Friday, refused to allow an injunction against &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2011/profile/facebook.php &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;a case begun by Chicago-based Timelines.com, which has been alleging that Facebook&#039;s newest innovation will &quot;eliminate&quot; its business.

The EVO 3D, EVO 4G, Thunderbolt and Sensation phones from HTC could have a security flaw that apps could exploit to access the users email addresses, a log of GPS locations, call logs, and text message data. The app could gain access to this information by requesting access to the Web--access that apps routinely ask for. HTC has said in a statement that it is looking into this claim. --NS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5845797/gizmodo-exclusive-looks-like-there-will-be-a-cheaper-iphone-4-made-in-brazil?popular=true&quot;&gt;A Cheaper, Brazilian-made IPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

 <title>Work Smart: Surviving The Project Plateau</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784483/work-smart-escaping-the-project-plateau?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Most ideas never happen because they get abandoned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/work-smart-project-plateau-620.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#039;re a lone creative or leading a team in a large organization, everyone can fall victim to the project plateau. It&#039;s the moment when the idea that got you excited enough to stay up until 3 a.m. or even quit your day job becomes one monumental to-do list. This is when most ideas, even the great ones, get abandoned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can avoid the project plateau with a little discipline. Start by killing your darlings, and creating short-term reward systems that will keep you engaged in a long-term pursuit. I explain how in this video.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[video_twistage 1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What &quot;short-circuit&quot; reward systems have you created for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is the author of the national best-selling book &lt;a href=&quot;http://the99percent.com/book&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Making Ideas Happen&lt;/a&gt; and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.behance.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Behance&lt;/a&gt;, a company that develops products and services for creative industries. Behance&#039;s products include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.behance.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Behance Network&lt;/a&gt;, the world&#039;s leading platform for creative professionals to showcase their work, and The &lt;a href=&quot;http://the99percent.com&quot;&gt;99%&lt;/a&gt;, a think tank and annual conference focused on leadership and execution in the creative world.

 <title>The Wasabi Fire Alarm Won&#039;t Wake Your Neighbors</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784124/the-wasabi-fire-alarm-wont-wake-your-neighbors?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/1144195039_9a129ce748_b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, an organization called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Improbable Research&lt;/a&gt; offers up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ig Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;, a Nobel spoof award that it is given for science innovations &quot;that first make people laugh, then make them think.&quot; This year, our favorite entry came from researchers at the Shiga University of Medical Science, who developed something called the wasabi alarm, a fire (or general emergency alarm) that slashes noise pollution but might make anyone nearby feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified the ideal density of airborne wasabi to awaken slumbering people in case of emergency, and then used that information to develop the alarm. The wasabi alarm patent explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odorant receptacle contains an odorant. A concentration of the 
odorant in air at which a person can no longer tolerate a strength of 
smell is lower than a no observed effect concentration of the odorant. 
The drive section causes the odorant to be emitted from the odorant 
receptacle. The detector detects occurrence of an unusual situation, and
 outputs a detection signal. When the detection signal from the detector
 is inputted, the controller causes the drive section to emit the 
odorant in accordance with the detection signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if the detector (a smoke detector, for example) senses smoke, it triggers a series of events that results in sleeping home-dwellers being woken up by the overwhelming smell of wasabi. It&#039;s probably not too pleasant, but it won&#039;t wake your neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the wasabi alarm wasn&#039;t the craziest idea to be given an Ig Nobel this year. Other winners include a study showing that a certain type of beetle mates with Australian beer bottles, a study looking at why disc throwers get dizzy but hammer throwers don&#039;t, and a study looking at how the urge to urinate impacts decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sifu_renka/1144195039/sizes/l/in/photostream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sifu Renka&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Special Deliveries </title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1783457/the-thing-quarterlyco-physical-artifacts?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Want to get your hands on James Franco&#039;s package? Two California outfits, The Thing and Quarterly.co, will mail you (through the Postal Service!) delightful, whimsical gifts curated by the likes of Miranda July, Dave Eggers, Jonathan Lethem, and, yes, the enigmatic one himself. Here&#039;s how to sell analog twee to a nation of tweeters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/brad-3-franco-inset.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1780716/can-technology-save-the-us-postal-service&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;you&#039;ve probably heard&lt;/a&gt;, the United States Postal Service is facing some of its toughest challenges in decades with estimated losses of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/postal-service-warns-it-could-lose-10-billion-this-year/2011/09/05/gIQAtJZO5J_blog.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$10 billion this year&lt;/a&gt; and the House of Representatives approving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/21/usa-postalservice-idUSS1E78K1MV20110921&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bill that could end deliveries on Saturdays&lt;/a&gt;. And while this is terrible news for every birthday boy and girl waiting for a crisp $20 bill in a card from grandma, for the rest of us life goes on. It goes on in the digital insta-verse: faster, more efficient, better for trees, sure, but also a smidge less wonderful? Who, after all, doesn&#039;t still get a tingle up their spine on those very odd days when a package (not from Amazon or Zappos) is there when they get home from work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Zach Frechette, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://quarterly.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quarterly Co.&lt;/a&gt; is hoping to bring a little wonder back to your mailbox by launching a subscription service for physical artifacts. For a $25 fee, subscribers receive packages every three months that have been hand selected by Quarterly Co. partners like Siobhan O&#039;Connor and Alexandra Spunt, co-authors of the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://nomoredirtylooks.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;No More Dirty Looks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://quarterly.co/contributors/alexis-madrigal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alexis Madrigal&lt;/a&gt;, a senior editor at The Atlantic, reflecting each contributor&#039;s sensibilities and passions. While none of the contents have yet been announced, they will range from curated consumer products to specially made objects sent directly to subscribers the old-fashioned way.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We spent the last decade moving as much of our lives online as we could, and we&#039;re better for it,&quot; Frechette, the former editor of GOOD Magazine, tells Fast Company. &quot;But we&#039;ve also learned in that time what things the Internet can&#039;t replace, and the value of tangible things that happen in the real world. For all the innovation that exists in the world of messaging nothing holds a candle to the raw emotional impact of getting something personal in the mail. That is an experience unparalleled in the digital world.&quot;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly.co isn&#039;t alone in the nascent objects subscription business. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethingquarterly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_Blank&quot;&gt;The Thing Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;, launched in 2007 by San Francisco artists Jonn Herschend and Will Rogan, brings together contributors like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethingquarterly.com/issue-1-miranda-july.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miranda July&lt;/a&gt;, who designed a word-art window shade, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethingquarterly.com/projects/james-franco.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;James Franco&lt;/a&gt;, who created a limited edition &quot;Brad Renfro Forever&quot; switchblade in honor of his friend, an actor who died of a heroin overdose in 2008. Dave Eggers and Mike Mills (the filmmaker and July&#039;s husband, not the R.E.M. bassist) are being tapped for future issues. Annual subscriptions for The Thing are $200, and, according to Herschend, the subscriber base hovers around 500, with a brisk business of non-subscriber one-off sales. Want that Franco switchblade? It can be yours for $650.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/issue-14-franco.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of The Thing is right there in its name: The very thingy-ness of the mystery objects its subscribers receive. &quot;We&#039;re both visual artists into the tactile sense of objects that we consider,&quot; Herschend says. &quot;Everyone has a stone that someone gave them. To the rest of us, it&#039;s not that interesting, but to each of us it is.&quot;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia Maloney, a subscriber to The Thing since its inception, says 
she sees the service as a gift that keeps on giving. &quot;When an issue is 
due to arrive in the mail, it&#039;s like the week before your birthday when 
you were a kid and you know a present is on its way from your favorite 
aunt, the cool one who really gets you,&quot; Maloney, 40, the Berkeley-based
 director of the online art magazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artpractical.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Art Practical&lt;/a&gt;, tells Fast Company. For Maloney, many of The Thing&#039;s issues are more than mere art objects. She proudly uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethingquarterly.com/issue-10-starlee-kine.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cutting board engraved with &quot;crying instructions&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from This American Life contributor Starlee Kine and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethingquarterly.com/issue-11-chris-johanson.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ceramic wine cups&lt;/a&gt;
 designed by artist Chris Johanson. Her husband, Smitty Weygant, even 
goes so far as to wear issue 7, a pair of eyeglasses printed with&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thethingquarterly.com/issue-7-jonathan-lethem.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; text by author Jonathan Lethem&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frechette summoned similar feelings of personal connection and nostalgia while launching Quarterly.co in Los Angeles. In an introductory Tumblr post headlined &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quarterlyco.tumblr.com/post/7849330591/why-im-starting-quarterly-co&quot; target=&quot;_Blank&quot;&gt;Why I&#039;m Starting Quarterly Co.&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Frechette recalls the pleasures of receiving a care package at summer camp from his mother, an expert at hiding contraband in seemingly mundane sundries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An Aspirin bottle was filled with Skittles; a deck of cards was carefully packed with chewing gum; a container of talcum powder was full of Pixie Stix dust; and a stuffed bear had been gutted to house a cache of--wait for it--Gummy bears…This package, and the ones that followed, transformed my summer from one of drudgery and despair to one of clandestine fun and ill-gotten popularity.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Quarterly.co is already sold out, but Frechette plans to add more subscriptions soon. Reading about his mother&#039;s incredible care packaging, one is tempted to wonder if she&#039;ll ever be among his roster of future contributors. &quot;I&#039;m working on getting her,&quot; he says. &quot;But she&#039;s a tough sell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Images courtesy of The Thing]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/Matthaber&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matt Haber on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/fastcompany&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Mindshare Technologies CEO John Sperry Addresses Your Complaints</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784097/innovation-agents-john-sperry-ceo-of-mindshare-technologies?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Got a beef about the bathroom in your local Arby&#039;s? Tell John Sperry. He&#039;s up to his ears in customer complaints. So why&#039;s he still smiling? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/irate-customer.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recession, schmecession. John Sperry can thumb his nose at the sluggish economy. The CEO of Mindshare Technologies just celebrated 100 months of consecutive revenue growth--all powered by customer complaints. No, clients aren’t whingeing about Mindshare. Instead, the company provides real-time survey and feedback solutions to the likes of such national chains as Great Clips and Café Rio Mexican Grill.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/John sperry smaller.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;john sperry&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;The way it works is simple. Participating companies will be notified immediately if there’s a problem that needs addressing. For example, you walk into a bathroom in an Arby’s location. It’s a mess and there’s no toilet paper. You, the customer, can report that via phone or online. The local Arby’s manager is then sent that feedback in real-time so he can mop the floor and replenish the rolls ASAP. Using Mindshare allowed Café Rio to snag the No. 1 spot among Quick-Serve Restaurant (QSR) Chains in the nation, beating out Chipotle, In-N-Out Burger, Chick-fil-A, and Pei Wei--all known for their attention to service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The core focus is in the value of one,” Sperry tells Fast Company, and too often customer experiences are averaged. But if you take your significant other out to dinner and don’t have a great experience, “How many times does that need to happen to you to make it statistically accurate?” Sperry answers his own question: too many times. The sample size of one is a way to connect customers directly with the store manager, Sperry maintains. “Corporate doesn’t matter. Money is made at the store level so greater involvement is needed in the store delivery equation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, Mindshare has 250 clients and collects about 200,000 pieces of feedback per day, bringing the total to over 1 billion customer insights and more than 60 million surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s more impressive, considering the company started during a time when Sperry, like so many other tech entrepreneurs, was pounding the pavement after the dotcom bust. Both he and a friend refinanced their homes and took out balloon mortgages to pool together about $40,000 of their own savings to start Mindshare in 2002. Their first 10 employees went without pay and even chipped in some of their own funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We went from gluttony to the starkness of no money,&quot; Sperry says. &quot;But innovation comes from starvation. It’s not something you buy, it&#039;s something you earn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the 85-person shop is on track to post $18 million in revenue for 2011, the painful bootstrapping years are in the rear-view mirror. Sperry says that while Mindshare is just as focused as ever on being a leader in the customer feedback industry, retailers and service providers are just beginning to understand the need to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sperry says the service sector experiences a 300% turnover in staff, which makes delivering consistently great customer experiences difficult. Mindshare’s platform is working to disrupt that by providing even more analytics with voice recognition software akin to that used by Watson, the supercomputer that competed on the game show Jeopardy! earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are making leaps with predictive technology,&quot; Sperry says. By merging that with single comment analytics, Mindshare presents a finely honed picture of what a business should offer its customers to maximize revenue. It makes it easy, for example, for chains to customize product and service mixes based on location. &quot;You would have a different store in a college town that you would in an [urban] downtown,&quot; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Sperry, &quot;The customer is king right now. They will take you to the promised land if you can listen to them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/whatwhat/3903504086/sizes/o/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;What What&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>How The Department Of Energy Plans To Wean The U.S. Off Rare Earth Metals</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784099/how-the-department-of-energy-plans-to-wean-the-us-off-rare-earth-metals?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/5390499101_f23ac549fc_z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare earth metals--a group of 17 chemical elements found in solar panels, wind turbines, electric car motors, lithium-ion batteries, and more--are critical to a future reliant on clean energy. The problem is that China has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1773009/how-the-us-could-end-up-with-a-plentiful-cheap-supply-of-rare-earth-metals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the majority of the supply&lt;/a&gt;, and it has used that leverage to slow exports and raise prices. The U.S. is working on building up rare earth production sites, but the Department of Energy is sinking millions of dollars into an alternative: rare earth alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOE &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/09/arpae-20110930.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+greencarcongress%2FTrBK+%28Green+Car+Congress%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; $156 million in clean energy technology funding this week, including 15 research projects that focus on what the organization calls Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies for Energy (REACT). The projects include electric vehicle motors containing little or no rare earth metals, a manganese-based replacement for rare earth magnets found in wind turbines and electric vehicles, a cerium-based replacement for rare earth magnets, and a carbide-based composite replacement for rare earth magnets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why so many magnet replacements? Small, light, and powerful rare earth magnets are found in most audio speakers, computer hard drives, wind turbine generators, electric cars, and even self-powered flashlights. In other words, if our supply of rare earth elements gets cut off, we&#039;re in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the funding comes from the DOE&#039;s ARPA-E program, which invests in high-risk, high-payoff clean technology (the program is based on DARPA). Post-&lt;a href=&quot;http://vox.fastcompany.com/1777470/why-its-not-such-a-bad-thing-that-a-solar-company-with-1-billion-worth-of-investments-went-o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Solyndra&lt;/a&gt;, many people may be skeptical of the DOE&#039;s investments. But without rare earth metal alternatives, the U.S. won&#039;t just lack new clean energy technology; it one day may not have the infrastructure to even support today&#039;s gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Image: Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/argonne/5390499101/sizes/z/in/photostream/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Argonne National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Jesse Middleton Juggles Three NYC Startups, Makes Jack Dorsey Look Lazy</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784113/wework-getminders-guyhaus-jesse-middleton?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/jesse-middleton-guyhaus-ceo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s serial entrepreneurship--when someone starts company after company, handing over the reins at a certain point to focus again on the early stages of building a business. Then, there&#039;s simultaneous entrepreneurship, which involves starting and running several, not-necessarily-related ventures at once.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two famous examples of the simultaneous startup CEO are &lt;a title=&quot;Jack Dorsey Square Interview on FastCompany.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1754859/how-square-is-accidentally-disrupting-the-entire-payments-industry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, with Twitter and Square, and Bill Gates, who ran the photography business Corbis alongside Microsoft. Now, a host of upstarts (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/citelighter-collegehumor-strange-bedfellows&quot;&gt;Citelighter,&lt;/a&gt; a company we wrote about in August) are trying to make this method work, sometimes financing one business with profits from the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Middleton is the CEO and cofounder of three emerging startups in New York: &lt;a href=&quot;http://guyhaus.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GuyHaus&lt;/a&gt;, a subscription-based, product delivery service for guys that&#039;s frequently compared to Birchbox; &lt;a title=&quot;twitter.com/#!/getminders&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/getminders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GetMinders&lt;/a&gt;, a service that helps seniors, or anyone, adhere to their medical regimen through phone and text reminders; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://weworklabs.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WeWork Labs&lt;/a&gt;, a co-work space which New York Magazine recently called the &quot;Best Shared Office Space&quot; in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leisure, it would seem, cannot exist in Middleton&#039;s world. But for the 25-year-old CEO, running simultaneous startups is not a sign of workaholism; it&#039;s a way of allowing his small businesses to collaborate, and share some resources, thereby saving him time and money throughout their stressful early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, Middleton says he&#039;s free to indulge in his lifelong passion, sailing. (He has a 27-foot Catalina and sails mostly off the coast of Maryland.) &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast Company caught up with Middleton in San Francisco recently, where he was meeting with potential investors and business partners. Here&#039;s what Middleton revealed about the benefits of entrepreneurial multi-tasking... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-left&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/guyhaus-logo.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAST COMPANY: You came up with the idea for GuyHaus in March and it&#039;s already funded. How did it pick up steam so quickly?
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Jesse Middleton&#039;s blog Srcasm.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.srcasm.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JESSE MIDDLETON&lt;/a&gt;: There are many reasons, but it really comes down to the people involved and whether there&#039;s an existing interest for the product. Investors invest in the early stage, when there&#039;s no product to be seen. But if they see that an idea is part of an emerging group-buying trend…investors will come along and say, &quot;You guys are a solid team, and other people are doing this successfully, so I believe in it.&quot; Subscription commerce is an area people are very excited about right now. Companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shoedazzle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ShoeDazzle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birchbox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Birchbox&lt;/a&gt; are starting up and succeeding. So, by taking that model and grabbing another vertical, you create an exciting spot to invest in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that out of the $21.7 billion men&#039;s grooming industry, there&#039;s a very large subset of consumers that don&#039;t really want to have to think about their shopping needs on certain essentials. As more people streamline their lives, live on their smartphones and spend more time online, shopping will change to follow suit, becoming simpler and more effective to just subscribe to and buy these goods online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is GuyHaus different than BirchBox?
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men don&#039;t like to shop. We like to be in and out. Where Birchbox delivers a variety of different samples for women to test and try out, GuyHaus focuses on essential items. Men come to GuyHaus and say, &quot;I need shower stuff, skin-care stuff, and shaving stuff.&quot; They don&#039;t want to experiment with 15 sticks of deodorant. Even though taking a few trips a month to [the drugstore] may not sound like such a big deal, it does take time out of your life. It&#039;s a stress point. And it doesn&#039;t have to be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
What&#039;s the response been so far? 
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We raised our first round of funding just three and a half months ago. Michael Oliver, Andrew Sternthal, and myself cofounded GuyHaus and raised our first round of funding about four months ago. We raised $250,000 from a great group of angel investors including Michael Yavonditte, Charles Smith, Jason Yeh, and Michael Edwards with &lt;a title=&quot;initiogroup.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.initiogroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;InitioGroup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We haven&#039;t had any cancellations from a customer yet! I assumed everyone would get their boxes the first month and say: &quot;What the hell is this?&quot; But that hasn&#039;t happened. The feedback we&#039;re getting tells us we&#039;re on the right track. But we&#039;re not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have described yourself as a &quot;lifehacker.&quot; How does your interest in personal efficiency apply to your other business ventures?
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own life, I&#039;m always looking to make certain experiences better and easier. I&#039;m definitely not like &lt;a title=&quot;fourhourworkweek.com/blog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tim Ferriss&lt;/a&gt;, author of The Four Hour Body, who went so far as to embed censors in himself to monitor his every move. But what I look for is: What are the repetitive, mundane tasks in my life that I can improve? Years ago, I wrote an app called HitMeBack. You text us something you need to remember in a number of hours, and then we hit you back at that time with the message. Sounds simple. But those are the sorts of things that excite me when it comes to technology: the simple ways that we can improve our life.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where does WeWork Labs, which opened officially in April, fit in?
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way I like to streamline my life, WeWork Labs helps early stage entrepreneurs streamline the creation of startup businesses. There are all these tasks that go into building a company, from software development to fundraising to marketing. If you&#039;re a few people in an office, you don&#039;t want to think about things like how to clean the space every night, or how to bring food in. If you&#039;re a developer, for example, you&#039;re concerned with finding someone to teach you about PR, or how to negotiate fundraising. WeWork puts all these people together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space is half membership-driven and half sponsor-driven. Our sponsors not only provide money to offset the cost of the space--so we can charge just $250 a month for members--but they also bring in services. For example, the WilmerHale law firm is providing free legal support to all 50 entrepreneurs in the space right now. Two of the partners are just there hanging out, in case anyone has any questions.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else are you working on?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spend time advising other little startups. I&#039;m no expert, but I&#039;ve been through the fundraising process, so I help out where I can. My main focus these days is GuyHaus, but I still work on Getminders, a [business] focused on medication adherence. The idea there is to leverage phone calls and text messaging to help people stay on track with their medication or health in general. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandfather doesn&#039;t have an iPhone, but he still needs to manage his medication regimens for his diabetes and Parkinson&#039;s. It works according to the same pattern: Getminders streamlines health management the way WeWork streamlines the startup process and GuyHaus streamlines e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits to this kind of simultaneous entrepreneurship?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, we don&#039;t pay ourselves out of WeWork at all. We reinvest the money back into the community, which can involve anything from launching &lt;a title=&quot;kickstarter posts on fastcompany.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/tag/kickstarter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; projects to throwing parties. At first this may not make sense. But the amount of support WeWork has given GuyHaus has paid back a hundred-fold. Since we work out of the WeWork space, we have access to dozens of friends and connections and resources. Other companies have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on their first design pass, usually. We were able to design our current site for less than $1,000 [with the help of WeWork friends]. That was huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Apple Rumor Patrol: Two iPhones, Or Not Two iPhones, That Is The Question</title>
 <link>http://www.fastcompany.com/1784043/rumor-patrol-two-iphones-or-not-two-iphones-that-is-the-question?partner=rss</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/iphone4s1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s just four days until Apple&#039;s &quot;let&#039;s talk iPhone&quot; press event, and we still don&#039;t know if we&#039;ll be seeing one new iPhone or two--and no idea if they&#039;re called 4S, 5, or just 4 and 4S. There&#039;s a good reason for this, namely Apple&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1783822/apple-nda-disclosed-the-ipads-private-planes-padlocks-and-photographic-evidence&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;strict code of silence&lt;/a&gt;, which must&#039;ve been dialed up a notch or two since the inafmous Gizmodogate affair before the release of the iPhone 4 last year. There is, as you might imagine, a lot of discussion about this online, ranging from pure speculation to genuine hardware clues, so we&#039;ve dug through the dross to find some diamonds for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/iphone-5-invite.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Invite Logo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the silliest speculation this week, leading to headlines like this one, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/28/talk_of_two_new_iphone_models_continues_to_cool_off_ahead_of_apple_event.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Talk of two new iPhones continues to cool off&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; centered on the graphic that Apple used as an invitation to the members of the press it selected to come to its Cupertino headquarters next Tuesday. The time and date, 10 a.m. PT on October 4th, were evident clues, but excitement about the Maps logo was off-target: Getting freaked that Apple&#039;s campus at Infinite Loop in Cupertino, which you have to get to via Route 280, is shown is irrelevant--because that&#039;s simply the icon Apple&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mygreatiphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/iOS-Maps-app-icon1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&#039;s the fact Apple used the phone image with a &quot;1 missed call&quot; flag in the corner, which has some thinkers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-5-invites-are-out-announcement-will-be-october-4-2011-9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; we&#039;ll only be seeing a single new unit revealed next week, coupled with the use of the phrase &quot;iPhone&quot; in the singular. Let&#039;s debunk this: Apple refers to its devices like this nowadays, to support the branding notion--it&#039;s &quot;iPod&quot; and &quot;iPad&quot; and &quot;iPhone&quot; when mentioned singly or in groups. And why would Apple go to the bother of telling pundits we&#039;re only going to see a single phone? In our mind, two iPhones are still a distinct possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&#039;s Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be the most concrete evidence yet that the new flagship device really is the iPhone 5 and that it has that radical new metal-chassic teardrop design we&#039;ve heard about: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/30/att_already_stocking_iphone_5_silicone_sleeves_in_stores.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silicone cases that match this profile&lt;/a&gt; have already shown up in AT&amp;amp;T stores, and numerous other &quot;iPhone 5&quot; cases are showing in the store&#039;s inventory computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/iphone5cases1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Apple may not be the exclusive BFFs that they once were, but you know that the two firms will have worked closely on the iPhone 5--to test how the device works on the network under controlled situations in the lab and on the street. With AT&amp;amp;T likely to sell millions of the things for Apple, you&#039;d expect that Tim Cook or Steve Jobs would&#039;ve told them if there was no iPhone 5, no new design and so on, before letting them order many an accessory for the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there&#039;s this video...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[youtube TU7iCNIumpc]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventory Items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the week numerous Apple SKUs have started showing up in store inventories. First up came the iPhone &quot;4S&quot; accompanied by what seemed to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/28/iphone-4s-packaging-label-iphone-5-prototype-video-probably-not/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaked photo&lt;/a&gt; of a box label that confirmed the name and that it was a world phone with both CDMA and GSM powers (thanks to the fact the label shows both an IMEI for GSM and an MEID for CDMA device identification).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/29/iphone-4s-appears-in-apple-inventory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Later evidence&lt;/a&gt; then suggested a codenamed N94 device, the new iPhone, is showing in store inventories with both 16GB and 32GB storage capacities. A separate &quot;N90A&quot; device is also in the systems, which has been identified as possibly a reduced capacity 8GB iPhone 4--based on previous Apple stock codes, and the fact it&#039;s a lower number than the new N94 units (which come in both black and white SKUs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/iphoneinvent1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debate centered on whether the device is called &quot;iPhone 4S&quot; or &quot;iPhone 5&quot; based on these leaked details, with the suggestion that the reduced storage iPhone 4 N90A is merely all the hardware from the current iPhone 4 but at a cheaper price, with smaller internal storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Replicant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at engineering drawings that supposedly leaked out of Apple&#039;s China supply &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/27/how-the-teardrop-iphone-design-wound-up-in-the-hands-of-every-case-maker-in-china/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;base some while ago&lt;/a&gt;, an enterprising chap named &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/29/wishful-thinking-some-guy-makes-his-own-aluminum-and-glass-iphone-5/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ben Miller&lt;/a&gt; took a block of aluminum and machined it to closely match the specifications, creating a faux engineering model replicant that hints at what we think is the design for the iPhone 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/fauxiphone5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check it out--it agrees nicely with our own Fast Company rendered imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China&#039;s iPhone 5--With Speed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China&#039;s upcoming iPhone launch partner China Unicom &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/09/29/iphone-5-to-support-21-mbps-hspa-4g-technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;let slip a few suggestive details&lt;/a&gt; this week. The company gave a presentation this week at Macworld Asia and their slide for the iPhone history included a blank slot for the &quot;iPhone 5,&quot; lending more support to the name, and a specs list that included mention of HSPA+ tech, with download speeds of 21Mbps. This is sometimes known as 3.5G or 4G tech (depending on how desperate a phone network is to make itself seem future-facing) and delivers mobile 3G speeds that European users have enjoyed for a while longer than U.S. ones. It&#039;s also much faster than the current 7-ish Mbps rate of the iPhone 4&#039;s wireless systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap iPod Touch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1781750/apple-should-kill-the-ipod&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We&#039;ve suggested Apple ditch its iPod&lt;/a&gt;, and evidence now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/30/apple_removes_ipod_classic_click_wheel_games_from_itunes_store.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; the Shuffle and Classic are indeed being killed off by Apple. But we also think Apple will show a slightly tweaked iPod Touch at the event, adding in white paint and speedier chips. &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2011/09/29/iphone-4s-appears-in-apple-inventory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Now it seems that&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid cannibalization of the (presumably) reduced price 8GB N90A iPhone, Apple is going to drop the price of the new 8GB Touch model to $199 or possibly less, to compete with devices like the Kindle Fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Company&#039;s Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cards on the table: We&#039;re &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1781564/the-apple-pie-the-tastiest-rumors-about-the-iphone-5-and-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pretty certain&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will show two new phones next week--a new iPhone 5 device with a new thinner, bigger-screen design, 8 megapixel camera and faster A5 CPU and a modified iPhone 4 with reduced internal storage but world-phone powers, which could be called the iPhone 4S (which may imply it could also have an A5 chip inside, in the same way the 3GS was a suped-up 3G with &quot;S&quot; standing for speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve not seen much hints of the actual skinny iPhone 5 because Apple has learned its lesson, and locked down security tighter than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is Apple, always mercurial, so we&#039;re also prepared to be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chat about this news with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/kiteaton&quot;&gt;Kit Eaton on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/fastcompany&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>This Week In Bots: Animaltastic Innovation</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-center&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/alphals3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;alpha dog ls3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AlphaDog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Boston Dynamics&#039; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/boston-dymanics-robots-tiptoe-nearer-terminator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BigDog quadruped robot&lt;/a&gt; gives you the willies with its amazingly animal-like skills at tromping across difficult land at speed, then don&#039;t watch the video of BD&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/military-robots/boston-dynamics-alphadog-prototype-on-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;newest iteration&lt;/a&gt; of its military assistant robot, AlphaDog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[youtube SSbZrQp-HOk]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BigDog was really the development prototype for AlphaDog, suffering from an enormously noisy engine and fairly limited operating range and payload powers. AlphaDog, on the other hand, is closer to a production dog droid that could actually accompany troops on the battlefield: It&#039;s quieter, can carry 400 pounds and run 20 miles without needing more gas, versus BigDog&#039;s 340 pounds and 12-mile range. Properly called the LS3 &quot;Legged Squad Support System,&quot; AlphaDog is also smarter at autonomous navigation, can right itself after a slip or fall, and will eventually be able to leap over some obstacles. After more development, AlphaDog will be tested by DARPA and soldiers in realistic outdoor situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocket Flea Bots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Maryland and the Army Research Lab may be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/30/tiny-jumping-robots-have-more-in-common-with-firecrackers-than/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only in the early stages&lt;/a&gt; of testing their self-propelled &lt;a href=&quot;http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/tiny-robot-makes-big-jumps-with-explosive-microrockets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flea-like microrobots&lt;/a&gt;, with the &quot;robot&quot; part reduced to being a simple mass as a faked carcass for a later, more sophisticated body, but the results are already impressive. The team is testing two different systems--one that uses tiny micro-engineered silicone rubber springs to drive a piston, and the other which includes a miniature solid fuel rocket engine, ignited by a micro-engineered resistor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[youtube hrlTwbiZmTE]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both systems work surprisingly well to propel the tiny devices an impressive number of body lengths in the air--much like a real flea--and the on-board light sensitive trigger for the rocket version is a hint at the further sophistication possible. Ultimately these devices, as you may suspect from their army research pedigree, may find use in battlefield or police situations, acting as spy drones or perhaps investigative imaging devices scattered into a building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birds and Roaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC Berkeley has sought inspiration in the construction of cockroaches and birds for its series of biomimetic research robots, demonstrating their &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5844273/robot-birds-and-octoroaches-on-the-loose-at-uc-berkeley&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Octoroach and Bolt&lt;/a&gt; machines this week as part of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[youtube 4b5sOru11Mg]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve seen similar devices before, but it&#039;s worth pointing out that these small devices are autonmous to a certain extent, packing navigation, propulsion, power, and sensor packages into their small bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flocking Swarms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flying robots are now a cultural norm, in the era of advanced aerial drones used to surveil battlefields--and sometimes to actually fire weapons, but they tend to be lone devices with limited payloads and tightly defined tasks and capabilities. The Laboratory of Intelligence Systems &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-09-flocking-robots-sky-video.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has been trying to develop&lt;/a&gt; this notion with research into aerial drones that are intelligent enough to fly in flocks. Their small electric-powered fliers contain propulsion, GPS, and control electronics and a Wi-Fi dongle powered by a specially coded Linux board that lets them communicate with other drones nearby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[youtube n_qRuHkD5lc]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devices can take off, form a flock, and then &quot;migrate&quot; as a group thanks to their radio chatter. In the near future devices like this will enable cheap, detailed on-the-fly ground imaging in much more real time than is currently possible and could find uses in mapping, search, and surveillance roles. They also strike us, if equipped with advanced 360-degree cameras, as exactly the sort of smart device Google would embrace for a more speedily updated version of Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float-right&quot; src=&quot;http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/viewmedia.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nurse Bot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robots aren&#039;t just the stuff of distant dreams, don&#039;t forget: Panasonic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/28/panasonic-shows-us-its-softer-side-intros-trio-of-high-tech-rob/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has just revealed&lt;/a&gt; three new nurse robots, designed for the care and assitance of elderly patients. Hospi-Rimo should let people who are stuck in bed or who have limited mobility communicate more easily with friends, family, and doctors through their screens, cameras, microphones, and wireless web connections. One edition of the new machines is actually a robotic bed that can transform into a wheelchair so that patients actually can move around without having to leave their sleeping platform, while another is designed to boost the dignity of an immobilized patient by washing their hair automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chat about this news with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/kiteaton&quot;&gt;Kit Eaton on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/fastcompany&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
