		<itunes:summary>Apology for the delay.  I’ve been slack, busy and unable to tee up a time to get a co-host.  Therefore you are stuck with me flying solo this episode. 
 In this short episode I want to talk about the basics of how to make money in Lord of the Rings Online.  Now don’t get me wrong.  I’m only talking about in-game money.  What I am talking about is that beloved copper, silver and gold game coins used to buy in-game items, repair, pay rents and give to friends to help them out.

 So here are some of the basics.  Please note that there are many more ways to make money but these seem to me to work the best.

Questing, Runs and Chaining
Early on one of the main ways to earn money is to simply chain quests and kill along the way.  In addition you get to either sell the reward items or equip them and sell your old gear.

Sometimes you will find a run where if you go through an area and loop back the things you have killed at the start have re-spawned.  Or you find a loop of crafting nodes that do the same with enemies there as well.  Try and find areas with high concentrations of easy to loot mobs or nodes.  Be aware that being incapacitated too much costs more than it is worth in most cases.

If you can dove-tail quests, deeds or node runs do so.  Chain them together to get more in a shorter space of time.  If you are running randomly all over the map you will more than likely not make the most of your time.  Taking those few seconds to read where things are and figure out if there is a deed to kill something there pays much better dividends as far as your bank balance goes.

Making Money with Empty Bags
Keep stack-able items.  From killing enemies you usually get drops that have a brown background.  If you get more than one you will find that they can stack in the one bag slot.  So therefore you can have 10x Skulls that only take up one space.  Also most crafting nodes will drop items that will stack as well.

Your bags can be like the TARDIS if treated right.  It can look small on the outside but, if you stack them correctly, they can fit a lot.

Keep only items for yourself or the A/H if you think you can use or sell them for a nice profit.  E.g. Legendary Items.
You can usually throw items out of your bags that have grey, yellow and even purple backgrounds.  However be careful with them and always keep an eye out for special items.  Crafting items usually have a lighter green colour.

Be mercenary if it isn’t going to be of any use and it isn’t worth much... throw it out.

Be methodical.  Keep things in order in your bags so you can see what you have.

Throwing out stacks of 20 items at 2silver each (that will sell for 40silver) for stacks of 10 items at 8silver each is worth it because you will make a 40more silver.  Although be careful how much time it takes to gather the higher value items.  Their drop rates aren’t as good so it can take a lot longer.

Always be keeping an eye on your inventory.  Are all the items in there what you should be carrying around when questing?  Do you really need that cosmetic item in your bags for example?

Making the Most of Housing and Vault Space
Houses are a great for extra storage.  I generally prefer to have a larger house.  Short term it isn’t going to pay off.  However over the long haul you will find that because you can dump items into the chests and keeping your bags empty you will be able to make more money.  Within a few runs you have made a nice profit negating the cost of rent and eventually the purchase price of the house.

My advice is the same for those chests as it is with your Vault space and also Shared Storage and Wardrobe.  Only keep items in there that are worth keeping.  All too often I have gone into my vault and there are low level items that “might come in handy” but have been there for 6 months or more.  Just vendor them.  With the extra money you can make you more often than not can purchase things like health pots and other goodies.

The special guest this week was Braki Basscleff from the Windfola server.  A veteran of Lord of the Rings Online and from the other side (the UK) of the world from Sparthir.

Sorry about the audio issues this week.  I tried to clean it up as best I could but some things are just a bit beyond me.

For some excellent guides on how the fellowship system works in LotRO check out the guides over at mmorsel.com.
