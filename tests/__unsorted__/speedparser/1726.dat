<h1 id="internal-source-marker_0.40399661334231496" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;"><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/10065320_a035.png" alt="" /><br />
</span></h1>
<p>The rules of marketing have changed. We’ve long been used to marketers pushing messages to buy their product in front of our attention: an ad on a billboard; a commercial on television; a banner ad on the Internet. Over time more and more ads are popping up in our lives in more places with more frequency. </p>
<p>But the effectiveness of this traditional advertising is fading. Consumers are now looking at their iPhones instead of at billboards, are fast forwarding TV commercials, and are ignoring Internet banner ads. Fortunately for marketers, however, a new approach has emerged. </span></p>
<p><span>The new approach is </span><a href="http://www.junta42.com/resources/what-is-content-marketing.aspx"><span>content marketing</span></a><span>. Instead of pushing their messages at prospects, content marketers are producing content that prospects value. It does not sell the marketer’s product but instead speaks in a compelling way to the needs, challenges, issues and aspirations of prospects. Prospects consume the content, appreciate the brand’s understanding for their concerns, and begin to develop a relationship with the brand. The brand nurtures the relationships it develops among this community and, over time, these prospects convert into customers. </span></p>
<p><span>Many marketers are using this new approach with great success. A classic example is AmericanExpress’ </span><a href="http://www.openforum.com/"><span>OpenForum</span></a><span>, a site that does not tout the advantages of AmEx to small businesess, but rather provides small businesses with content about their concerns and needs (e.g. “</span><a href="http://www.openforum.com/articles/the-5-steps-to-managing-a-disgruntled-employee"><span>5 Steps to Managing a Disgruntled Employee</span></a><span>”). AmericanExpress is altering its relationship with small businesses, building tremendous trust and appreciation and signing up large volumes of new customers. </span></p>
<p><span>Producing OpenForum for AmEx is the digital agency </span><a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/"><span>Federated Media</span></a><span>, who in addition produces content marketing publications for brands like P&amp;G, L’Oreal and HP. Federated is also a Kapost customer, and as they and other content marketers have signed up over the past several months, we&#8217;ve researched them and their needs deeply. </span></p>
<p><span>Content marketers have had an immensely positive reaction to our service and have provided us great insight on features we&#8217;ve built and continue to build for their needs. <a href="http://www.contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/09/future-of-content/">We think that content marketing drastically changes the economics of content creation</a></span><span>. And we see content marketing today as only the beginning of a massive change in how brands relate to customers. As a result, we have focused Kapost on content marketing, serving marketers as the first and only service of its kind: an end-to-end platform that enables marketers to succeed as publishers and win at the new game of marketing. </span></p>
<p><span>We will continue to serve our existing media publisher customers and are eager to work with new ones. The functionality needed for media publishers and content marketers is very similar. </span></p>
<p><span>But our focus going forward will now be content marketers. We look forward to continuing to work with the marketing industry to develop a new world of marketing that delights prospects rather than annoys and generates tremendous new sources of customers and revenues for brands. </span></p>

<div>We&#8217;re excited to announce our latest release today!</p>
<p>The first upgraded feature is the <strong>New &#8220;Create Post&#8221; button:<br /></strong></div>
<div>The &#8220;Create New&#8221; button at the very top right side of Kapost has been updated to be cleaner. It&#8217;s the same button, just looks different.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/new_post_button.png" alt="" /></p>
<div>The second feature is <strong>Scheduled Publishing: </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />This feature allows you to schedule a post to be published in the future, instead of manually choosing to publish each post. &nbsp;Once it is scheduled, it can still be edited and adjusted but when that time rolls around, the post will be pushed to live, onto your publication.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div>
<div><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mockup_2.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<div>The third feature is <strong>Custom Post Types:<br /></strong></div>
<div>
<div>Custom Post types is a feature that is highly customizable and part of our effort to enable editorial teams to fit their product workflow. In the custom fields area in Settings (in your Kapost newsroom) has been moved to a new tab.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The main part of this feature is that if you want all your posts to have another date field, or another image field, or be a top ten list post this is now possible.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mockup_3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you have any questions at all, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out.</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kapost CEO and Co-Founder, <a href="http://twitter.com/tobymurdock" target="_blank">Toby Murdock</a>, recently wrote a guest post around his content marketing vision on the esteemed <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com" target="_blank">Content Marketing Institute. </a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve included an excerpt here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The media publishing industry is undergoing tremendous transformation in its transition to digital. One of the more powerful forces in this change are economics, and the oft-repeated phrase is that media is trading “print dollars for digital dimes.” In other words, <strong>as media moves more online, publishers are receiving only a fraction of the revenue they used to receive in print for the equivalent amount of content produced</strong>.</p>
<p>These changing economics raise many concerns and high among them is the question: <strong>Who or what will fund the production of content?</strong>  The demand for content is as high as it has ever been, and despite the onset of user-generated content, demand for quality, professionally-produced content remains strong. If the economics of online are going to fundamentally reshape the revenue potential of media publishers, where will the money come from to pay for professionally-produced content?</p>
<p><strong>The answer could come from the segment where content production is really booming: <a href="http://www.junta42.com/resources/what-is-content-marketing.aspx" target="_blank">content marketing</a>.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>As part of this, there&#8217;s a new &#8220;Publish&#8221; popup that&#8217;s cleaner and supports a drop-down for multi-publish. In addition, on the post page, you will see that categories are now easier to add and remove.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Toby and I flew into Cleveland for the first annual, <a href="http://www.contentmarketingworld.com/">Content Marketing World </a>conference. With over 16 countries represented and 600+ attendees, we were excited to be part of this growing industry and group.</p>
<p>We had our first booth in the exhibitor hall and also, presented at their Technology Cage Match, which included closing with a haiku on what Kapost does!</p>
<p><em><img class="aligncenter" src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tobypresenting.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="355" /></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve included some photos here (note on the go phone photos) and some informational highlights.</p>
<p><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tobycmw.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="420" /></p>
<p><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tobyandgrace.jpg" alt="" width="556" height="413" /><br />
<em></em></p>
<p>Speaker Highlights:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>From Sally Hogshead:</strong></p>
<p>A study from BBC showed that due to web browsing, our attention spans have shortened. Our attention span used to be 20 minutes long and over generations it is now 9 seconds.</p>
<p>How do you stand out? The best idea doesn&#8217;t win if no one pays attention in the first place. It doesn&#8217;t matter how great your blog is, if no one reads it. It&#8217;s not about being the best, it&#8217;s about finding a way to take who you are and create a relationship that is captivating.</p>
<p>Rebellion is the root of all creativity.<strong></strong></p>
<p>David Meerman Scott:</p>
<p>The most overused in English language, used in press releases is: <em>innovate</em>.When referring to &#8220;real time&#8221; he states: Don&#8217;t use stock photos. Use real employees on your website. Use real people to represent real people and REAL language. Always think about the second paragraph of the story. <strong></strong></p>
<p>Jay Baer:</p>
<p>The future of marketing is helping, not selling.</p>
<p>Coined: Friend of mine awareness. You build an inside circle of trust by <em>helping</em> consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Clark, Copyblogger:</strong></p>
<p>Be reader focused. Don&#8217;t take for granted that people will pay attention to you. Everything needs to be reader friendly.</p>
<p>Number one mistake in creating content is not focusing enough on the audience&#8217;s needs.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Personal highlights: </strong></p>
<p>Opening night at Rock N&#8217; Roll Hall of Fame on the water. With delicious appetizers and drinks, we mingled among the greats and toured the famed museum.</p>
<p>Kevin Smith, (aka Silent Bob) stand-up at a comedy club, which was really a personalized Q&amp;A. He also was the <a href="http://www.contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/09/kevin-smith/">closing keynote for the conference.</a> One of the funniest guys, who you can tell, is brilliant and privvy to the online world and business.</p>
<p>We had a great time and met many people in the industry. We&#8217;re looking forward to more converastions and continuing to help fill a need for content marketers.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the third post in an ongoing series called, <a href="http://kapost.com/category/blog/kapost-customers/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kapost Customers</span></a>.   We will be featuring some of our wonderful customers, learning their   editorial process, featuring their great online publications and of   course, learning how they use Kapost. Enjoy!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to introduce <a href="http://www.thefashionspot.com/profiles/167169-jennifer-davidson">Jennifer Davidson</a>, Managing Editor of <a href="http://thefashionspot.com">TheFashionSpot.com</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>1. Tell us about your yourself and your publication.</strong></p>
<p>I am the managing editor of The Fashion Spot, an online fashion magazine and subscriber-based fashion community that reaches over 1.5 million readers per month. </p>
<div class="im"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">2.  What were some of the editorial challenges you faced before using  Kapost and subsequently, what are you able to do now that you couldn&rsquo;t  before?<br /></span></strong><br />Managing a freelance writing staff spread out across the country and Europe, publishing 10 or more articles per day was cumbersome to manage. We used &nbsp;our own combination of calendars for scheduling, online documents for planning, and email for sending articles and photos. It worked, but it was far from elegant or ideal.</p>
<p>Kapost has revolutionized our editorial process, streamlining everything from pitching story ideas and scheduling to uploading content and images. There&#8217;s virtually no learning curve for my writers and it allows the editorial staff, also spread out across the country, to seamlessly manage every stage of content production.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<div class="im"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">3. What are the three most important features Kapost offers your team?<br /></span></strong><br /><em>Scheduling: </em>Managing our editorial calendar is a breeze.</p>
<p><em>Organization: </em>We no longer have to email articles, images, and comments back and forth. Everything related to an article is neatly contained in Kapost &mdash; notes, supporting documents, revisions, comments, copy, and images are all in one place and accessible from anywhere, by anyone with permission.</p>
<p><em>Efficiency:</em> Now that we use Kapost, we no longer have to transfer an article from an email or a word doc into our CMS. Our writers submit and format their own articles, thereby saving us time (and money!)</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<div class="im"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">4. What do you love about your job?<br /></span></strong><br />I love managing a talented team of writers who create interesting and entertaining content. Seeing an article go from concept to published article is a thrill.<br /><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><strong>5. How has working with Kapost increased your efficiency? </strong></span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br /></span></strong><br />Our efficiency has increased incredibly. Personally, I have cut at least an hour from my day that was spent on mundane tasks that are easily handled by Kapost. We were also able to dramatically cut the hours spent formatting articles which puts less of a burden on our staff, saving us money.</div>

<blockquote><p>Kapost offers a software-as-a-service that is intended to help editors,  who are under increasing pressure to produce more stories, to streamline  the content-creation process from assignments to publishing to payment  of freelancers.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>You can find the PR Daily review here as they break down what we do for web-based editors and contributing writers: </em><a href="http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/9428.aspx"><em>New Platform Helps Web Editors Better Manage Their Sites.</em><br /></a><br /><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/screen_shot_2011-09-08_at_12.52.41_pm.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote><p>With digital platforms eclipsing traditional media, a big challenge for  online editors, publishers, and writers is finding a tool that  replicates in the virtual world what takes place in a physical newsroom. </p>
<p> Whether it&rsquo;s a brand journalism website or a more familiar news site,  online editors grapple with how they can communicate with writers (who  often work remotely), edit their copy, measure the reach of their  stories, and make sure they get paid. </p>
<p> A new publishing platform called <a href="http://kapost.com/">Kapost</a> aims to remedy that situation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kapost is a dream tool for many Web editors</strong></em></p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we get to know our customers better, we listen closely to their pain points.  Sometimes it&#8217;s managing their editorial calendar, other times it&#8217;s being able to message many users at once.</p>
<p>One item we have consistently heard to be a big source of pain is<strong> invoicing.</strong></p>
<p>Editors often face trouble with invoicing around formatting, freelancers send in different versions of invoices, receiving verification of the posts and finally, getting them in on time.</p>
<p><strong>That said, we&#8217;re happy to announce that today, we&#8217;re solving this problem as we&#8217;ve released a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">new invoicing feature</span> within Kapost.  </strong></p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<p>Any post that has a payment on it is listed in a transactions table. When you&#8217;re looking at that table of posts, you can select any of them and click &#8220;Create Invoice&#8221;. Doing so will list those posts in an invoice and list the invoice in the new &#8220;Invoice&#8221; sub-tab.</p>
<p>For organizational purposes, that invoice must then be confirmed by both the Editor and the Contributor.  Once that is done, the invoice is &#8220;Completed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any invoice that is completed can be printed and paid by your own accounting department or you can pay it directly in Kapost using PayPal.  If you pay inside Kapost, we&#8217;ll keep a record of the payment for you to always find and refer to.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to see it quickly in action, check out this video:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iTWWRZ3QnRc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We know this is a big issue and hopefully this starts to make the invoicing process less daunting and scary.  Furthermore, we have some more features in the queue, such as auto-creating invoices and adding arbitrary amounts.</p>
<p>Please let us know what you think about our new invoicing feature!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="im"><em>This is the second post in an ongoing series called, <a href="http://kapost.com/category/blog/kapost-customers/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kapost Customers</span></a>.  We will be featuring some of our wonderful customers, learning their  editorial process, featuring their great online publications and of  course, learning how they use Kapost. Enjoy! </em><br /><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><em>Today, I&#8217;m excited to introduce <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lcuthbert">Lori Cuthbert,</a> Editor-In-Chief of DiscoveryNews.com</em></span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"></p>
<p><img src="http://kapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/screen_shot_2011-08-30_at_2.04.48_pm.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>1. Tell us about yourself and your publication.</span> </strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Editor-in-Chief of <a href="http://news.discovery.com/">DiscoveryNews.com</a>, a science and technology daily news website.</span></div>
<div class="im"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">2. What were some of the editorial challenges you faced before using Kapost and subsequently, what are you able to do now that you couldn&rsquo;t before?</span></strong></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br />Discovery News is a remote operation; my team is spread across five time zones in a few different hemispheres. We didn&#8217;t have one place where everyone who works for Discovery News could interact &#8211; an online water cooler, if you will &#8211; share ideas, make pitches and see what everyone else is up to. As Editor-in-Chief of Discovery News, I needed a place that allows me to oversee my newsroom, as well as manage my writers, without having to use a handful of software programs. Kapost is that thing.</span> </p>
<div class="im"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">3. What are the three most important features Kapost offers your team?</span></strong></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br />Kapost lets us all see what each other is doing in one place &#8211; or not, if we want to just see a subset of the whole. That transparency makes it easier to manage story pitch and publication flow, and the calendar function allows a high-level view of the publishing highway that we just don&#8217;t have now. So, Discovery News writers can see incoming story pitches from other writers, and can avoid duplicate pitches. Editors can field pitches all in one place, and writers can submit their stories right there too. Also, Kapost allows commenting within each post, which keeps a record of back-and-forths about specific stories in one place. No more searching emails for chains.</span> </p>
<div class="im"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">4. What do you love about your job?</span></strong></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><br />I love a lot of things about my job, but mostly the variety of what I do. I get to learn something new every day; I get my mind blown routinely multiple times a day; I get to make people smarter about the world they live in.</span> <br /><!-- BEGIN KAPOST ANALYTICS CODE --><br />
