<p>Instant history is a wonderful part of our current society.</p>
<p>Recency obfuscates perspective. And it&#8217;s often what gets noticed (and actually remembered) is not always what&#8217;s important, but what gets the most eyeballs.</p>
<p>We see it in sports, on the news and now we get to see in your own life with Facebook&#8217;s latest update to your profile: <a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150289612087131" target="_blank">Timeline</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Timeline turns our profiles into our very own online autobiography, curating our Facebook-based history of activities, photos and other assorted media into a narrative.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Because Facebook want users to fill in the blanks. And encourage more usage of Facebook-based apps (also highlighted heavily in today&#8217;s <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/22/new-facebook-open-graph/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Mashable+%28Mashable%29" target="_blank">f8 developer speech</a>) so users will get in the habit of sharing our actions and producing content around the activities from our lives. And Facebook can track the subsequent data.</p>
<p>In other words, solving <em>their</em> problem.</p>
<p>Because recent data &#8212; immediate data &#8212; is the best data. And Facebook wants to give advertisers the ability to target users on ever more data sets, specifically on the media users consume.</p>
<p>What wasn&#8217;t discussed was the brand pages, how those profiles will change and all the Likes you&#8217;ve accumulated mean anything. There is a reason for that. For one, they haven&#8217;t figured it out. But also brand Likes do not have same engagement as an app, nor offer the same constant ability for users</p>
<p>Because if you&#8217;re not part of Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/22/new-facebook-open-graph/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Mashable+%28Mashable%29" target="_blank">Open Graph</a> and adding to the data, you&#8217;re invisible. Likes are okay and all, but Zuckerberg wants more. He can&#8217;t sell brands on Likes. Certainly, he&#8217;s tried over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Whether this works or not teeters on one very important question: Do users finally feel comfortable publishing even more about their online activities?</p>
<p>When Facebook announced their wildly invasive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Beacon" target="_blank">Beacon program</a> in 2007, the answer to this question was an unequivocal no. Yet just a few years later, with the same smiling Zuck on stage, it appears we&#8217;re all jumping on board.</p>
<p>And yet, nothing has changed. Facebook still has the same philosophy about what it wants to do with that data. So it needs to scare you into loading your life onto the Book of Faces and happily provide it.</p>
<p>Scaring you into thinking, without uploading pictures (and likes and video and songs and movies and your life), it didn&#8217;t happen. Holding us hostage to add to the Open Graph. Otherwise, our story isn&#8217;t being told. Or worse, we&#8217;re forgotten.</p>
<p>And when it does happen, and we add more photos or whatever, it goes right to the top. Becoming the most important thing about you. Instantly.</p>

<p id="top" /><a class="lightbox" title="998243013_4d4f335f40" href="http://www.pointtopoint.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/998243013_4d4f335f40.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9126" title="998243013_4d4f335f40" src="http://www.pointtopoint.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/998243013_4d4f335f40-378x300.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After a spending few days at last week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.contentmarketingworld.com/" target="_blank">Content Marketing World</a>, I felt as though I had just left the bar at closing time.</p>
<p>I came out of there dizzy. Drunk on good (no, great) ideas. But still, dizzy.</p>
<p>Myself and many of my content-loving brethren heard a lot about a return to authenticity. We heard about engagement. And removing stock photography from our sites and replacing them with our own. Fascinating our target audiences. Becoming more transparent.</p>
<p>And the positivity hangover lasted even a day later. But then, as it&#8217;s prone to do after a long week, came Saturday. And with it, The New York Times feature on Chicago-based start-up <a title="Web site of Narrative Science." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/business/computer-generated-articles-are-gaining-traction.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=tha26" target="_blank">Narrative Science</a> that sobered me up rather quickly.</p>
<p>From the NYT:</p>
<blockquote><p>The company’s software takes data, like that from sports statistics, company financial reports and housing starts and sales, and turns it into articles. For years, programmers have experimented with software that wrote such articles, typically for sports events, but these efforts had a formulaic, fill-in-the-blank style. They read as if a machine wrote them.</p>
<p>But Narrative Science is based on more than a decade of research, led by two of the company’s founders, Kris Hammond and Larry Birnbaum, co-directors of the Intelligent Information Laboratory at Northwestern University, which holds a stake in the company. And the articles produced by Narrative Science are different.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>Not only can the company take relevant data and produce pretty decent content, Narrative Science is already doing so for clients as large as the Big Ten Network and Hanley Wood.</p>
<p>With apologies to those who are all in favor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)" target="_blank">Skynet</a>, this newfound progress of artificial intelligence should terrify content marketers, content strategists, journalists, bloggers and all those who dabble in the written word.</p>
<p>But, again, it <em>should</em>. It doesn&#8217;t. And I&#8217;m all for it. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>While authenticity should be a hallmark for your content strategy and marketing, authenticity doesn&#8217;t scale well. Writing to fascinate target audiences, and getting them to convert takes a tremendous amount of time, energy and thought. Not to mention replicating said time, energy and thought to each of your target audiences. Now try doing this for each one of your clients.</p>
<p>This stuff is hard. Anything of true value should be.</p>
<p>One of the painfully obvious takeaways about the content marketing space is that it lacks a diverse tool set and data aggregators that can truly help the content marketer/strategist without reverting to freelance help. Yes, in this day and age, we are all publishers. But we don&#8217;t have to all be writers.</p>
<p>What I am not saying is that we should outsource our writing to HAL 9000 instead of freelancers. Artificial intelligence cannot replicate our previous experiences that develop true insights to make a difference for customers or prospects. At least not yet, and Narrative Science isn&#8217;t close. But what it <em>could</em> do is save us time. It <em>could</em> get us that first draft after we&#8217;ve plugged in the numbers. It <em>could</em> help us organize our facts into a narrative. It <em>could</em> even identify areas our research missed. And the best part? It&#8217;s all unique, and royalty free.</p>
<p>Who really knows what the future holds? But the writing world is going to continue to change. Get over it.</p>
<p>Just as we use a number of tools, formulas and automation to help with SEO, page design, social media, email and PR, we need to think similarly about we can make content marketing better.</p>
<p>Something smarter.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;re overwhelmed. And there is just too much content being produced daily to <em>not</em> to develop better ways to identify, aggregate, organize and write smarter prose.</p>

<p>If you missed it, on Monday night, the New York Jets played the New York Giants in a preseason NFL game. While amazing in and of itself, a certain area of the Twitter world exploded in delight.</p>
<p>The reason? Tweets. On. Screen. Oh, and hashtags! They used hashtags!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/darrenrovell/status/108355694863978497" target="_blank">TV personalities</a> tweeted in delight. Scribes at Reuters typed away <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/consumer/sns-rt-us-newyorktre77o4xc-20110825,0,2426100.story" target="_blank">furiously</a> at the innovation.  The engagement!</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, this is not a new concept, nor is it innovative. One needs only to look at ones local TV affiliate&#8217;s NBA postgame to watch the ticker of mildly censored, wildly insufferable text messages from fans. Not to mention the many non-sporting events that already do this.</p>
<p>We get the sentiment. By alluring the fan base that you&#8217;re engaging them, you&#8217;ll get free content, more brand engagement and the like. But what does it add to the final product?</p>
<p>Let me ask the question another way: What does the local sports talk radio show gain from caller John from Lakewood to the final product?</p>
<p>The radio show gets to kill some time. But the audience gets nothing of nutritional value. John from Lakewood is not an expert. He&#8217;s a fan. Pretty sure he&#8217;s had a few beers.</p>
<p>Similarly, why do we want to read tweets from @giants1111?</p>
<p>One only needs to look at Twitter during Monday Night Football, Thursday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, Sunday Day Football, etc. to see that people are already discussing the games with their friends and followers. The only reason they&#8217;d need a hashtag for an NFL game is to measure it for <em>their </em>purposes, not for the audience.</p>
<p>TV and Twitter integration is already happening. This is inevitable. Twitter is even currently searching for a <a href="http://www.ventureloop.com/ventureloop/jobdetail.php?r=f_sh&amp;jobid=73336&amp;utm_source=SimplyHired&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=SimplyHired">content manager</a> purely for the purposes rapidly integrating the two.</p>
<p>But we need to stop asking questions like: <em>How do we integrate Twitter and TV?</em> because it&#8217;s the same terrible question as <em>How do we integrate the internet and TV?</em></p>
<p>And why get answers like the perpetually forgettable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV" target="_blank">WebTV</a>. And tweets on TV.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to start asking how we make our TV viewers&#8217; (the customers) experience better. Because that&#8217;s the type of thing that&#8217;ll get the experience to a higher level. And why I&#8217;d choose to watch one show over another, or one game over another.</p>
<p>Why not train sideline reporters to tweet more content (including photos/video) than is already being shared? Why not take a blogger/Twitter personality and ask him to write dry, rather obvious in-game observations? (hint, I do this already) Why not have a personality-driven Twitter chat ready to go for halftime? Oh, and by the way, add some advertising in between tweets and share it with Twitter headquarters.</p>
<p>Is it really that hard to come up with better ways to integrate sports and Twitter than with the brute force of tweets on screen? We&#8217;re already watching with our laptops, mobiles and iPads, please keep the TV screen focused on the show at hand. Remind us, yes. Ask us questions, yes. But let&#8217;s not give @giants1111 his/her big break.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason WebTV has yet to take off, and has been trying to since 1996. Random tweets masquerading as entertainment enhancements won&#8217;t either. There is innovation to be had with Twitter and TV, I just wish someone would start asking the right questions so they can find it.</p>

<p>Marketers jumping in the content strategy world face a hard truth.</p>
<p>For the majority of content development projects you will work on, you are not a part of the intended audience. This is not a bad thing, but the quicker one realizes this, the better.</p>
<p>One must build personas and really understand the target audience and how they consume content before even getting started.</p>
<p>These truth goes well beyond content (and into all user experience and interfacing), but for the purposes of content strategy and eventually marketing, one should never infer or assume what your persona is, does or wants or that your previous experience is going to help.</p>
<p>Persona-building is hard. But that&#8217;s OK because it makes it all the more relevant when your content and hard work nails it. And that&#8217;s really the goal: to be as relevant as possible to prospective clients, customers and users.</p>
<p>So how does one build a persona for content strategy and marketing, especially when you&#8217;re not commissioning a $100,000 study? Below, I&#8217;ve listed some shortcuts that marketers can use to get started with their personas or to validate existing persona-building research.</p>
<p><strong>Go to the trade publications.</strong></p>
<p>This is an oldie, but goodie to get a headstart on demographic data. While publications in consumer markets are declining, many industries in the BtoB marketplace still exist as though the internets never existed, and they still rely on advertising and subscriptions to stay afloat. This means that they probably have a decent media kit in which you can glean very important information about their users. After all, the pubs want advertisers that match their demographics, so they are quite happy to tip their hand. Even better, just ask them what content on their publication website gets the most traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Website behavior.</strong></p>
<p>While heat mapping, existing content performance and are all par for the course nowadays, even without those tools, one can look at Google Analytics and quickly determine the most visited pages, most landed on pages, most exited pages, pages with best time on site, bounce rates, etc. You can also determine pathways and funnels very quickly to determine if existing content is being accessed in the way you originally intended. If not, it&#8217;s back to the content marketing drawing board.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword research.</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of tools out there to determine the relative frequency in which people are searching specific terms. That&#8217;s not hard, and should be a given. But the a-ha moment comes when you use the tools to determine if certain searches are going up and preparing your content appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark studies.</strong></p>
<p>You may not be able to commission a study, but there are plenty of organizations that have done the work on chefs, building products, architects, doctors, moms, and Russian mimes. Get. That. Data. Research shops and data warehouses are very good at what they do, and better at this than most.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service representatives. </strong></p>
<p>If you or a client has a customer service department, it should not be too difficult to determine the top 20 questions customers routinely ask. Help the department out by getting and optimizing your content around these questions. Heck, use them as individual blog posts or videos and plaster them across the social sphere.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook demographics. </strong></p>
<p>Using social media for research purposes should be old hat. But specifically Facebook&#8217;s ad serving tool is actually a great way to determine sub-segments of existing personas, validate age ranges, the size of a certain demographic and understanding the things they like to read, eat, listen to, or even their political leanings. Aggregating this data can be difficult, and may be more so if Facebook starts locking it down for advertisers, but the tool remains at this moment.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, these types of tactics are to be performed in addition or supplementing the hard work of persona-building, or after the types have been identified. But because content strategy and marketing is so specific, adding additional ways to validate data never hurts.</p>

<p>By now, you&#8217;ve certainly heard about Google&#8217;s latest venture into the social sphere, <a href="https://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a>.</p>
<p>While Google&#8217;s many (failed) ventures into social networks <a href="http://www.pointtopoint.com/2010/02/why-buzz-bugs-me-tips-for-google-caffeine-optimization/">are well-documented,</a> Google+ appears to already gained some traction. Following the Wave and Gmail script, Google utilized a strict invitation-only process for new users to stymie unchecked growth.</p>
<p>And before the majority of actual humans have had a chance to set-up shop and post (and re-post) their cat photos, a number of companies, entities and brands have already elbowed their way through the door.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/2084288/ford-jumps-google-wheels" target="_blank">Most notably Ford</a>.</p>
<p>Ford, led by head of social media and super gentleman Scott Monty, have been praised over for years on their successful social strategies. And rightfully so. In many ways, they&#8217;ve been pioneers for big brands utilizing social media, like when Alan Mulally, the CEO, was doing Twitter chats while many large organizations still blocked social websites altogether.</p>
<p>But when Ford showed up on Google+, it was an obvious odd fit. Not too different from when brands jumped into Facebook with human profile pages, Ford had to choose it&#8217;s gender and birth date. <em>Awkward</em>.</p>
<p>With the internet equivalent of the Wild West before us, Google VP of Products, Bradley Horowitz, <a href="http://www.seanpercival.com/blog/2011/07/04/google-brand-page-concept/" target="_blank">quickly denounced the brand pages</a> very early on in the field trial.</p>
<blockquote><p>”Let me be clear – and I’m sorry if this wasn’t obvious –  we are not currently supporting brands, organizations, and non-human  entities in the Google+ field trial.</p>
<p>Supporting these non-human entities is an obviously great feature –  we have no allergy to it at all! It’s just not part of the system we are  currently testing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet Ford&#8217;s (and others&#8217;) brand pages remained. Obviously, Ford wants to tout their social media prowess. They also know their audience and they&#8217;ve been very successful integrating social media into marketing for quite some time.</p>
<p>But how social media-friendly can you be when you&#8217;ve been told you don&#8217;t belong? And is it any different than spamming a LinkedIn group or tweeting about myself all day?</p>
<p>Thankfully, Google is putting an end to the madness. Last night, Christian Oestlien the Ads Leads for Google+ announced all business profiles are kaput, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105923173045049725307/posts" target="_blank">right on his Google+ page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>How users communicate with each other is different from how they communicate with brands, and we want to create an optimal experience for both. We have a great team of engineers actively building an amazing Google+ experience for businesses, and we will have something to show the world later this year.</p>
<p>The business experience we are creating should far exceed the consumer profile in terms of its usefulness to businesses. We just ask for your patience while we build it. In the meantime, we are discouraging businesses from using regular profiles to connect with Google+ users. Our policy team will actively work with profile owners to shut down non-user profiles.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re so oblivious to brands infiltrating our lives. And interruptive marketing still rules the day. But as social becomes more sophisticated, my hope is that brand managers will not just replicate their strategy from social site to social site, setting up shop as they go.</p>
<p>In social media, we know it&#8217;s incredibly important to be where your customers are. But it&#8217;s just as important, actually more so, to know when and where you don&#8217;t belong. Ford is going to do the right thing, I just hope other entities follow suit.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I spoke at Kent State&#8217;s YouToo Conference on the topic of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DJLitten/ignoring-seo-at-your-own-peril" target="_blank">ignoring SEO</a>.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine, talking about SEO with a bunch of PR practitioners at a social media conference meant that my &#8220;breakout session&#8221; was more like a &#8220;campfire discussion.&#8221; Especially in comparison to the keynotes and more sexy topics that were going on at the same time.</p>
<p>Fair enough. I need to better understand my audience.</p>
<p>But this ignorance goes beyond a specific conference and my hurt feelings. Like when I see some of PR&#8217;s most retweeted minds continually flipping, flopping and forgetting opinions on the subject (links omitted because posts keep disappearing).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to overgeneralize a segment of marketing, especially one I love and occupy, but many PR practitioners need to get over themselves. The ignorance (or worse, disdain) for SEO is often at odds at the very shiny objects PR wants to own, namely social media and content strategy, marketing and development.</p>
<p>We covered this a few different ways on this blog, but let&#8217;s just agree <a href="http://www.pointtopoint.com/2011/01/the-cost-of-producing-content/" target="_blank">content is expensive</a>. Let&#8217;s also agree that clients want to get the most out of this pricey prose.</p>
<p>Therefore, would anyone disagree that content is exponentially devalued without proper optimization and indexation? Without it, a piece of content&#8217;s shelf life is minimized. How is anyone going to find your whitepaper the day after you tweet it out? Or that incredibly-time-consuming infographic the day after it&#8217;s posted on your blog? Or case study after it&#8217;s on Facebook page?</p>
<p>Are we so arrogant to believe our followers are following at our own inflection points? Let&#8217;s look at some recent data.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://searchengineland.com/search-sends-more-better-traffic-to-content-sites-than-social-media-study-says-72988" target="_blank">one publisher</a>, 41% of external traffic to their websites comes directly from search. Compared to 11% from  social.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.emarketer.tv/Article.aspx?R=1008282&amp;dsNav=Rpp:25,Ro:3,N:909&amp;xsrc=TagCloudPanel" target="_blank">a comScore study</a>, buyers &#8220;who purchase or convert online are almost as likely to use a combination of search and social resources (48%) as they are to use just search (51%) along the path to purchase.&#8221; Leaving a magical 1% making purchases on social alone.</p>
<p>It should be apparent at this point that you cannot over-update your audience into content consumption.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s ignore that people make more purchasing decisions via search than social alone. Let&#8217;s ignore PR&#8217;s new-found love of social media, content marketing and strategy. Let&#8217;s keep quiet that PR and social media struggle for relevant statistics.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get even more basic: the website. Specifically, the one that belongs to clients. How many agencies (PR or marketing in general) want to develop a client&#8217;s new or existing website?</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>So how can these agencies ensure maximum value for their clients by ignoring best practices in web development, many of which are accepted or implied by the search engines? I say this (again) because it isn&#8217;t just about stuffing keywords. SEO is so, so much more. It&#8217;s about proper markup and site hierarchy. It is also about making sure your site loads fast and user-friendly.</p>
<p>PR can&#8217;t share and tweet and +1 and Like it&#8217;s way to SEO success. The search engines aren&#8217;t there yet, regardless of what you&#8217;ve heard. Practitioners need to get their hands dirty in SEO minutia. And get past tactical keyword-research and press release distribution sites.</p>
<p>SEO has so many PR-friendly benefits, it&#8217;s absurd to me that PR practitioners wouldn&#8217;t be jumping at the chance to add SEO to their capabilities. Perhaps it&#8217;s finally time PR takes SEO seriously.</p>

<p>If you read about SEO as much as I do, you&#8217;ll see it get blamed &#8211; or worse, marginalized &#8211; for many things and reasons.</p>
<p>Price. Pandas. Pestilence. You name it. We even see it die <a href="http://www.pointtopoint.com/2011/04/dead-seo-more-like-zombie-seo/" target="_blank">on a regular basis</a>.  Last week, an editor of <em>The New York Times</em> decided that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/palafo/status/65972467436490752" target="_blank">&#8220;SEO is BS&#8221; and that search engines will be a relic</a>.</p>
<p>But none of it has prepared me for what I read in <em>The Atlantic</em> this week: &#8216;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/google-doesnt-laugh-saving-witty-headlines-in-the-age-of-seo/238656/" target="_blank">Google Doesn&#8217;t Laugh&#8217;: Saving Witty Headlines in the Age of SEO</a></p>
<p>From David Wheeler&#8217;s article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, as newspapers embrace search engine optimization, and as young  journalists are taught to value Google visibility above all else, many  copy editors fear that funny headlines are quickly going the way of the  classified ad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Absurdity aside, let&#8217;s first get this misplaced blame out of the way: Online publications don&#8217;t have to rewrite anything.</p>
<p>[Pushes up nerdy glasses]</p>
<p>Most have the ability to separate these fields, allowing writers/editors to write a separate, more descriptive and SEO-friendly  headline that goes in the title tag (purely for the search engines), while keeping their  witty, pun-filled headline as is (which is usually an H1 and for the readers). Yes, you&#8217;d want the terms/phrases you&#8217;d like to rank for in  both fields to maximize SEO-friendliness of the content, but this is an easy win for both audiences. Even then, I&#8217;ve recommended to clients that they change the headline to the more  SEO-friendly version after the initial day (or issue).</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s another thing:  many traditional newspaper sites already have this ability built into their CMS. Publications like the <a href="http://twitpic.com/4wnkhw" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>. The New York Times does it too, just check out the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/world/middleeast/07photo.html?_r=2&amp;hp" target="_blank">headline and the top of your browser</a>.</p>
<p>For many journalists, SEO = headline + keyword stuffing. It&#8217;s all they know. However, if  journalists really want to know and understand how SEO can help them and  their publications they should worry a lot less about the importance of headlines and  focus on their company&#8217;s sitemaps, site architecture, endless duplicate content, internal linking  and the like.</p>
<p>But they won&#8217;t. Many journalists opine about headlines and keyword stuffing  because that&#8217;s all the information their SEO team is giving them. And it&#8217;s all most care to know.</p>
<p>Sadly, it&#8217;s nothing more than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank">Maslow&#8217;s hammer</a> at play.</p>
<p>What those at <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Atlantic</em> may not know is that not everyone in SEO came from the web development side. Some of us are writers too. Always were. Sat in the same journalism classes. Perfected ledes for a JV field hockey games. Brainstormed those punny headlines they hold so dear.</p>
<p>SEO + journalist types rolled up their sleeves and figured out the best of both worlds. They learned how to syndicate, aggregate and update to the masses.</p>
<p>We get the love for your headlines, we&#8217;re just over it. SEO didn&#8217;t kill the cute headline, the click did. The sheer volume of content, growing exponentially and shared on social media, rendered the witty and non-descriptive headline useless. We consume media so radically differently than we once did, so why are some  journalists clinging to out-dated best practices?</p>
<p>Better yet, how does the story get written in the first place?</p>
<p>With their reams of content and years of stories, established newspapers and magazines should be dominating the search engines. But they fell asleep at the wheel. So, if you want to blame anyone, don&#8217;t blame SEO for the loss of your precious headline-writing skills. <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/techcrunch-writer-calls-mashable-pathetic-but-is-he-right-2011-05" target="_blank">Blame your peers</a>.</p>

<p>I promised myself I wouldn&#8217;t. But I must.</p>
<p>Reuters writer Deborah Cohen took the path literally hundreds have taken before. Asking, albeit in roundabout fashion,  about the death of SEO with an overused headline, &#8220;Is SEO DOA?&#8221; and a lede that only a mother could love.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ron Springer is overhauling his company&#8217;s website and is spending a big chunk of his marketing budget to help boost its search engine ranking. He had no idea he might be throwing his money away on an outdated strategy.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs like Springer may want to  reconsider pouring money into search engine optimization (SEO) as their  primary marketing strategy, according to Chris Dixon, who recently  penned a controversial blog, titled: &#8220;SEO is no longer a viable marketing strategy for startups&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poor Ron Springer? Poor <em>readers</em> who read through this nonsense.</p>
<p>While the article gains some momentum (and common sense),  I couldn&#8217;t get past the strawman Ms. Cohen set up and thoroughly knocked down in the opening paragraphs.</p>
<p><strong>Who thinks SEO should be the entire marketing budget or core strategy? </strong></p>
<p>Really? In 2011?<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Humblebrag/clarification time. I&#8217;ve worked with &#8220;SEO&#8221; in a variety of settings. I&#8217;ve worked with (and as) freelance SEOs. I&#8217;ve worked at an SEO shop. I&#8217;ve worked as an SEO in two very different agency settings. I&#8217;ve worked with very large organizations and with start-ups. Not even in my early days, did we recommend or want clients that utilized their entire marketing budget on SEO.</p>
<p>It never ends well. Haven&#8217;t we moved on from this?</p>
<p>Where is the outrage for spending budgets on email marketing and email-only shops? Can we pronounce email DOA? What about those brands who bet on social, only to revert back to traditional advertising a year later?</p>
<p>With the exception of SEO&#8217;s who are nothing but link-builders, SEO has to touch and be a part of something. Like the website. You know, only the most important marketing asset your company owns and encompasses your entire brand online. So when Ms. Cohen discusses SEO conferences touching other marketing disciplines, she acts as if it&#8217;s some recent occurrence. Post-2001, onsite SEO <em>has</em> to incorporate other parts of marketing. <em>Has</em> to.</p>
<p>But back to poor Ron Springer. I have no idea his situation, budget or goals. But it appears that he needed a redesign, and his current site didn&#8217;t have SEO in mind, so he built an SEO-friendly site.</p>
<p><strong>How can this possibly be a bad thing?</strong></p>
<p>So many sites and businesses would benefit if their design, content and marketing incorporated SEO best practices. Perhaps the year before, he fixed his product. Or brand. Maybe now is the first time he could incorporate SEO into his marketing budget.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned that the majority who claim SEO is dead, or no longer works or doesn&#8217;t cure cancer, really didn&#8217;t have a firm understanding of all the niches that SEO encompasses or helps. I have no doubt Ms. Cohen or Chris Dixon, the entrepreneur she brings into the discussion, had the best of intentions.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;ve bought into the idea that SEO is some magic ball of technical secrecy. An idea no different than the snake oil salesmen who pervade the SEO industry.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re website sucks, SEO isn&#8217;t going to help.</p>
<p>If your product sucks, SEO isn&#8217;t going to help.</p>
<p>If your brand sucks, SEO isn&#8217;t going to help.</p>
<p>If you replace &#8220;SEO&#8221; with &#8220;social media&#8221; or &#8220;email&#8221; or &#8220;people stuffed in animal costumes on the street,&#8221; no one would argue. Yet when SEO doesn&#8217;t have an immediate ROI for a start-up, people like Chris Dixon throw it under the bus.</p>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s surprised new, often unproven technologies are not something everyday Americans are searching for?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, most product searches still start with the search bar. Which is why SEO will continue to be relevant.</p>

<p id="top" /><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7952" title="4046186580_7697051722" src="http://www.pointtopoint.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/4046186580_76970517221-400x300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>For those at least dabbling in SEO and social media for a few years, you&#8217;ve heard this story before.</p>
<p>Google is/has/will be a social hub, a social network, a social something. To FINALLY be that  intersection of search and social. To succeed where they and others have failed.</p>
<p>And by now you&#8217;ve likely read all about Google&#8217;s latest venture into social search: <a href="http://www.google.com/+1/button/" target="_blank">+1.</a></p>
<p>But for those in the SEO realm, what does this mean for you? Should companies be integrating +1 in SEO and social media plans or processes?</p>
<p>No. Not yet. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p><strong>+1 solves a problem that does not exist.</strong></p>
<p>Raise your hand if at any point if you&#8217;ve ever felt such a deep connection to a perfect search result that you felt compelled to do something about it. Because that&#8217;s exactly what Google has asked of searchers.</p>
<p>In theory, the +1ing process would work like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search the Googles for glitter unicorns.</li>
<li>Find the best glitter unicorn result in the universe.</li>
<li>Click on said result.</li>
<li>Love the result so much that you go back to your search and +1 the search result for www.sparklyunicorns.gov.</li>
<li>Go back to enjoying your glitter unicorn paradise.</li>
<li>Hope those in your social circle are influenced by your investigation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Who would do this?</p>
<p>Even if the site had a +1 button/widget (akin to Facebook&#8217;s Like button), there is no benefit to the user (unlike Facebook Likes). I do not get updates. I don&#8217;t get a forum to opine on my subject/company/site.</p>
<p>I just click a button &#8211; for Google&#8217;s sake &#8211; and hope my social circle sees this.</p>
<p>Now I understand why Facebook added Likes across the web, and how others have added Likes into their social or blogging routine. Likes are built into Facebook&#8217;s DNA. So why would anyone add +1ing into their searching routine? The user gets nothing in the short-term, yet marketers are to assume that users will do this on a large scale?</p>
<p>Again, who would do this on such a large scale?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>The same type of people whose goal in +1ing was a ploy to&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Game. The. System. </strong></p>
<p>Because +1 will &#8220;influence search rankings&#8221; it&#8217;s trying to force companies (and SEOs and social media-ers) to stick the +1 button on their sites, or risk their rankings. Whatever that means. By adding +1 to both organic and paid search, Google only succeeds in  giving nefarious SEOs and spammers an avenue to  game the system, or think they are.</p>
<p>Even worse, the +1 phenomenon keeps social sites as a place to beg for votes.</p>
<p><em>Want to get the latest deal? +1 my site.</em></p>
<p><em>Did you like my presentation? Please +1 my blog.</em></p>
<p><em>If you +1 my site, I will do the same for you. </em></p>
<p>The thing is, Google knows this. They have to know this will result in a lot a of bad data. Therefore, there is no other conclusion than the value from +1 data has to be low. Lower than all the SEO signals we already have in place. To be meaningful, +1 data will need a lot of time and massive adoption.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the point again?</p>
<p>+1 is not a revolution nor should it be considered a signal in social search for SEOs and social media practitioners.</p>
<p>With thousands of ranking signals and data points available, Google decided to give marketers a PR stunt rather a tangible metric to  make the web a better place.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a like an awful  tattoo your buddy got on spring break to look cool. A tramp stamp on my beautiful SEO signals and variables, and in my results and on my sites.</p>
<p>And for Google, just as  regrettable.</p>
<p>By shamelessly copying Facebook&#8217;s Like, +1 gives us the best example of a &#8220;Me too!&#8221; since <a href="http://searchengineland.com/microsofts-ceo-ballmer-google-is-copying-us-51786" target="_blank">Google copied Bing&#8217;s layout</a>, then <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-is-cheating-copying-our-search-results-62914" target="_blank">Bing copied all of Google&#8217;s search results</a>. They&#8217;ve soiled their reputation as an industry leader just to mimic their biggest competitor. Again.</p>

<p>Social media&#8217;s infancy has come to an end. And left behind is a graveyard filled with the best of intentions, budgets and smart people.</p>
<p>Whereas it was once enough to be a part of the conversation, I think (hope) that we&#8217;ve finally grown up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no better example of this maturity than the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>Last year, the Indians went on a limb.  In a shrinking city and a distant third in hearts, minds and wallets of fickle Cleveland pro sports fans, the Tribe needed something (anything) to break through the LeBron-based fog that hovered the Forest City.</p>
<p>With a poor season prior, and the NBA&#8217;s best player working next door and deep into the summer, the Indians devised the <a href="http://www.pointtopoint.com/2010/04/cleveland-pro-sports-and-social-media-tribe-social-deck/" target="_blank">Social Deck</a>, a section dedicated to fans in the social realm to do what they do best.</p>
<p>A media darling locally and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=5120106" target="_blank">nationally</a>, but with no peer in comparison, it was almost certainly a learning process. Who do we invite? What do we want out of this? How do we tie this to revenue? For a lot of 2010, the Indians didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Social media infancy at it it&#8217;s best.</p>
<p>Which leads us to 2011. Opening Day is a week away, and the Tribe is back at it.</p>
<p>While not a markedly better situation talent-wise, the competition for pro sports dollars in Cleveland certainly is. LeBron skipped town and the Cavs became NBA&#8217;s Washington Generals. The Browns fired another coach and wait in limbo for an NFL season that may never happen.</p>
<p>And yesterday, the team unveiled their plan: <a href="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110324&amp;content_id=17095004&amp;vkey=pr_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle" target="_blank">upgrading the Social Deck to the Social Suite</a>, increasing access to more employees via Twitter and more.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all great. But there is a better story. With lessons, data and C-level buy-in in hand, the Indians&#8217; social strategy grew up.</p>
<p>Like that they&#8217;ve tied social activities to revenue with social-specific tickets. Or that they&#8217;ve brought sales, advertising, PR and marketing departments together on social. Or that they know they only way to sustain long-term growth is that they need to increase relevant content to break through the thousands of messages consumers receive on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Indians have realized that social media is not to be thought of as some self-contained energy source, nor some whiz bang tool that will save the day.</p>
<p>It is a tool. It has a cost in people, content, time and energy. It needs to pull its own weight.</p>
<p>Like email. Like dollar dog night. Like Travis Hafner.</p>
<p>Most organizations never realize this.</p>
<p>So while many are reporting how great the Indians are at embracing social, it&#8217;s about time we stop placing social media on a pedestal.</p>
<p>It can be smart business and it can be bad business. But it&#8217;s business, and should be judged accordingly. First and foremost.</p>
<p>After just a year, the Indians know this, why haven&#8217;t most practitioners?</p>
