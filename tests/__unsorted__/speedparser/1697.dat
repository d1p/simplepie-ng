I am a huge fan of Jac's work and was excited to build a site to showcase it. ←Back to Index I really felt that Jac's photos speak for themselves and I wanted to let them do all the talking. Giant thumbnails compose the vast majority of the single-page site, and while there are many images, they load quickly and in succession, much quicker than other flash-based portfolio systems.Visit jacjacjac.com →






	communicationI've made myself available via email, twitter, or by phone, so feel free to drop me a line regarding just about anything. However, I'm a big fan of signal over noise, so why don't we just keep our Facebooks and our Linkedins to ourselves?				about meMy name is Jory Dayne — I was named after a campy 1971 pulp western by Milton R. Bass. I'm a graphic designer and illustrator living in a vale between a lake and some very large mountains in Utah. I like it very much. read more →
