    <description>The past few years have been a tremendous struggle for my wife and I. We have had a lot of ups and downs and there seems to be no end in site. Wednesday, September 9, 2009 will make 6 weeks in rehab for her and nearly two months in the hospital. Since I have loads of time to write, I thought this would be a great place to start.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Entries/2011/4/18_People_Who_Inspire_Me_-_Part_3_files/Screen%20shot%202011-04-18%20at%2010.30.45%20PM.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Media/object001_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:254px; height:135px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dr. Tim Robnett is the man. The guy’s been in two Rose Bowls, pastored and grown a church from the ground up to hundreds of people, written several books, worked for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://palau.org/&quot;&gt;Palau team&lt;/a&gt; for more than 20 years and has personally coached hundreds of evangelists. One of them luckily has been me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than the prestige of the ministry and life he has led, Dr. Tim has been a spiritual dad to me. As the Director of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ngateam.com/&quot;&gt;Next Generation Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Tim allowed me to participate in a historic trip to Poland to unite the churches and share Jesus to thousands in a city that had been first oppressed by the Nazis, then the Russians and then left to their own devices following all of the turmoil of the last 70 or so years. The trip was at the beginning of  Amy’s four year battle with cancer and through that trip, a deep friendship and love for each other was forged.&lt;br/&gt; After Amy passed away, I retreated to the Robnett ranch just about a year ago. Dr. Tim spent time with me, shoveling up after the horses and even teaching me how to ride. We talked about life and ministry and love and loss. He’s a great listener. His wife Sharon is a great cook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in between our first meeting in Portland for training on international evangelism, and retreating to his ranch after the death of my wife, are many conversations, phone calls, cards, trips together and lessons learned. Dr. Tim oozes of integrity. He’s helped me understand my identity. He champions evangelists. I am so thankful God brought him in to my life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last year, Dr. Tim moved on from the Palau team and I got to once again see integrity in action. While the shifting of the economy has made jobs unstable, I got to watch first hand as Tim and Sharon stepped out in faith to start a ministry to coach evangelists, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ministrydynamics.org/&quot;&gt;Ministry Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;. (You can watch a video about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/21453656&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing that I am, or even the potential I have not yet realized would not have been possible without Dr. Tim. If you respect &lt;a href=&quot;http://f2fmi.org/&quot;&gt;my ministry&lt;/a&gt; and anything I do, you can credit a large portion of it to this man. So here’s my plea to you: support his work in mentoring evangelists and join his mailing list! Help him mentor other evangelists. Give him the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ministrydynamics.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;financial support&lt;/a&gt; he needs to keep moving. </description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Entries/2011/4/2_One_Year_Later_-_Reflections_on_Life_After_Death_files/IMG_0643.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Media/object000_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:254px; height:135px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’s been a year since my dear wife, Amy passed away. As I sit at her mum’s house writing this blog and spending these last few days with her family, I think about the next steps forward for me as I continue on my journey alone. There are many questions about where to go from here and part of me finds it difficult to dream. Still, I push aside that feeling of disappointment and look forward believing that God has bigger plans than I can ask or think (Eph. 3:20).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomorrow will be the one year anniversary of Amy’s passing. I’m not sure how I feel about it at the moment, but I have been watching the days on the calendar go by and anticipating April 3rd’s coming. I don’t know if it is because I think that I will somehow be magically released from missing Amy, find a new beginning on the 4th or just achieved a milestone on the road to recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have decided to take my wedding ring off tomorrow. I will give my wedding bands to my best friend and his fiancee, Nathan and Rhiannon. They will wed this October and my prayer for them is that they will build their marriage on the same things that Amy and I built our marriage on. While Amy and I did not raise a family together, we spent the last decade wrestling through our faith in Christ and what that means to us as a couple. I really want that for Nathan and Rhiannon. I hope that our bands will serve as a reminder of that struggle and that they will take on that challenge as they build a family together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I find it interesting how people relate to me nowadays. As I share Amy’s story, I find that all kinds of people have connected their own personal stories of grief and suffering with mine. Everything from divorce to infidelity; the loss of a child, cancer patients and their carers, the elderly, financial hardship, et al. I guess it’s because losing Amy is something that is so connected to the heart that everyone reaches out to me as I reach out to them. And in those moments, as my new friend Rob said, the Lord has given me access to people’s souls; access that I previously did not have. It sets the stage for real ministry. It’s terrifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hate that I am unmarried but I don’t like the idea of remarriage. My friend Jim said to me, “I am a better man married than single...” I think I agree with this statement. I appreciate so many things about marriage. However, the idea of marrying again seems like an impossible thought. Forget about the fact that Amy was dead set against the idea of me moving on. What’s really challenging to me is starting the whole process over and having to go through all the different stages of a relationship with someone new. I don’t like that. I liked the set up I had. I liked my life. I love my in-laws. I don’t want any of that to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But change is inevitable and I’m not set in my ways. I remain open to the Lord and whatever He wants to do with me, wherever He wants me to go. Obedience has never been a problem, but waiting always is.</description>

      <title>So Easily Distracted</title>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Entries/2010/7/27_So_Easily_Distracted_files/photo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Media/object001_3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:254px; height:135px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well, sabbatical is long since gone and our busy season has nearly arrived. I can’t believe it’s been 3 months since Amy passed away. I came home to a horrendous amount of work. However, I am enjoying my privacy and spending my free time alone with the Lord. I am far from over all that I have been through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, how do you cope with loss? This is a question that I am asking, not preparing to give an answer for. I can certainly tell you all what not coping looks like. I have some older friends who have loved and lost someone to cancer. Their first response was to run out and get re-married immediately. It has been a real struggle for me not to fall in to this same mentality. In fact, without accountability, I will end up right where these guys are - not that I am judging the way they have chosen, it’s just not right for me. That’s one of the reasons it will be good to have a guy roommate.&lt;br/&gt; A friend told me recently that they really struggle with bearing the name of Christ for fear of misrepresenting his name. I question that big time. The whole thing that makes being a Christian so appealing is putting on the name of the One who is worthy because I am so unworthy. I am embarrassed of who I am without him. I get my identity from him! Without him, I am nothing. And I constantly wander away. Being a Christian is not about doing everything right, but it’s about knowing where to go when everything is wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I find that in the roughest of times for me, I beg the Lord as David did in the Psalms, “Keep me as the apple of your eye, hide me in the shadow of your wings...” (Psalm 17:8). God, as much as I need your protection from outside forces, I need to be hidden in you! Let your light shine through me and transform me! Let others see you in me, and not me. Let no one see me. I surrender unconditionally to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I got no answers for loss. I would be lying if I were to insist on saying that I am not broken. I have tried to fix things on my own and I assure you it makes things worse. I am undone.&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Order my re-released debut book, Schizophrenic by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/uploads/Schizo_Order_Form.pdf&quot;&gt;downloading the PDF order form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Like this post? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.f2fmi.org/content/view/40/63/&quot;&gt;Leave a tip&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

His name reflects something of his personality. He’s a wide horse and has to be ridden with a Western saddle. As I climb aboard, I can feel his massive hips beneath me. He’s not a smooth walker. He sort of slugs along as if he’s walking from his hips and not his feet. He sort of wobbles back and forth as he carries me along. He knows I am a new rider. He’s has already expressed an interest in having a relationship with me. However, this doesn’t come without a bit of fun first at my expense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My first ride out of the ring wasn’t terrible. I mounted the horse without falling off and did a few laps around the ring before going out the gate and up in to the hills of North Plains. Along with me was Jenna (daughter of world evangelist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikesilva.org/&quot;&gt;Mike Silva&lt;/a&gt;) and Dr. Tim, my gracious host. It wasn’t a long ride, but Player who knew that I was new, decided to test me around every corner. He would pick at all the plants, grass and leaves off of trees that we passed. he would go under trees and the branches would hit me in the face. I think the stinker was trying to knock me off! He even trotted down the road at a pretty brisk pace only to stop suddenly to take a drink from a puddle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I haven’t fallen off yet, but I know I am not a true rider until this happens. I dread this experience, yet I want to master this thing. My riding pants are a little tight and there is soreness in places I didn’t think were possible. In just a few moments, I am heading out for my third ride. Wish me luck and GIDDEYYYUP!&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Order my re-released debut book, Schizophrenic by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/uploads/Schizo_Order_Form.pdf&quot;&gt;downloading the PDF order form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Like this post? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.f2fmi.org/content/view/40/63/&quot;&gt;Leave a tip&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Entries/2010/5/17_Amys_First_Birthday_Without_Me_files/IMG_1668.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/The_OfficialTomtheBomb.com/Blog/Media/object003_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:254px; height:135px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am in an old gold mining town in northern California called, Grass Valley - roughly 70 miles north of Sacramento. The first half of the day, I sit in Starbucks reflecting on Amy’s life, my life and what comes next after this. I spend time writing creatively, journaling, thinking about the next year of my life, five years, ten.. Who knows the future? Not me, but I am so glad I know the One who does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amy would be 28 today if she were still here on earth. I couldn’t help but think about what we would be doing if she were still alive today before drifting off to sleep last night. We certainly would not be celebrating. The day would probably be like all the same: laundry, cooking, cleaning, changing her, trying to work my regular job and somewhere in there looking for ten minutes to go upstairs to Steve &amp;amp; JoAnn’s to vent. I’m glad that both Amy and I don’t have to live like this anymore. However, if she were here, I’d still be quite happy to be at home with her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People have been very opinionated during this time. Some of it helpful, some of it not so much. As I sift through all the emails, I would like to share a few positive (and anonymous) examples of the kinds of things being written:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Loss is always difficult, even for us as believers, but with the assurance of Heaven we can have peace in the understanding our loved one is enjoying eternity free of pain and the trials of this life. She is having a blast with Jesus and is now a part of that great cloud of witnesses that is cheering you on as you are going about the Father’s business...”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Amy's pain is finished and she is now face to face with Jesus. I think it is not a coincidence that she was called home on Good Friday and Easter weekend... God's reminder to you of the hope of the resurrection.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“I prayed on occasion that God would use the marvels of medical technology to bring healing to Amy’s brain. I prayed that God would miraculously intervene and do something that is beyond the understanding of medical science. But in the end I prayed that she would experience the greatest miracle of all… heaven.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These words were comforting. Others were too, but I liked these ones the best. it’s nice to know there are many out there who keep it real and keep an eternal perspective on things. It’s a hard perspective to maintain, but it gives so much focus to the years we spend on earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of you, my friends, have stood with me during difficult times. Many of you served in helpful ways and even to those of you who did not quite get it right, your love and concern have been duly noted. All I have in my heart to all of you is gratitude. I may never finish answering all the emails, cards and notes that many of you have sent. This is the best place for me to share with you how I feel. Thank you everyone for loving Amy and me. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More to come...&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Order my re-released debut book, Schizophrenic by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialtomthebomb.com/uploads/Schizo_Order_Form.pdf&quot;&gt;downloading the PDF order form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Like this post? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.f2fmi.org/content/view/40/63/&quot;&gt;Leave a tip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;</description>
