<p>We only have <strong>10</strong> copies to sell through the label, with the rest being sold by Katerwaul directly at gigs, so if you want to get your hands on this great package you had better move fast!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>06.09.10</strong></p>
<p>Stick it in the diaries because this is the date that we will be releasing the BRAND NEW Double A-Side Single from Katerwaul &#8220;Valley Under A Concrete Sea&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not only are we so good to you that we are going to be offering the download of the album on a &#8216;Pay What You Want&#8217; basis, starting at £0&#8230;but we also have a great little physical set to offer too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-730" title="Katerwaul Single Release" src="http://braveorinvincible.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSCF1310-1024x768.jpg" alt="Katerwaul Single Release" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>We will be selling copies of &#8220;Valley Under A Concrete Sea&#8221; on vinyl CD (which is basically a disk that plays as a CD but has the lovely appearance of a 4.72&#8243; vinyl record); to be accompanied with a fold out map/lyrics sheet, and also a beautiful A3 poster designed by Katerwaul&#8217;s very own Tim Courtney.</p>
<p>AND&#8230;</p>
<p>To celebrate this great news, Katerwaul will be having a (pre)release party on the 4th of September, where you will be able to pick up a copy of the CD and a poster before anyone else!</p>
<p>But more news on that to follow soon, so keep your ear to the metaphorical, internet based, ground.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we&#8217;ve been talking for a while now about releasing a compilation/mixtape, and now that we are getting ever closer to a release, we thought it&#8217;s about time you had some details.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked a lot in the past about making physical product interesting and desirable and so we&#8217;re not just releasing any old compilation in the &#8217;standard&#8217; way. Firstly, we&#8217;re releasing actual mixtapes, and by this, we mean cassettes. But that&#8217;s not all&#8230;we have also recruited the help of 9 different artists/designers so that every single cassette that we sell is going to be 100% individual and unique. We&#8217;re releasing 100 cassettes and every single one will have it&#8217;s very own artwork. Here&#8217;s a few examples from the 100 cassette covers that we&#8217;ll be selling:</p>

<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s a whole variety of art too; and this is only a snippet of the 100 cassettes that we have! We&#8217;ll be putting up a blog, or page on the BOI site, to showcase all of the art we have and all of the artists very soon.</p>
<p>But&#8230;it&#8217;s not all about the art, of course the original purpose for this mixtape was to release some great music, and we have definitely got that. In no particular order, the BOI Mixtape: Volume 1 will feature tracks from&#8230;</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-494" title="Katerwaul" src="http://braveorinvincible.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/l_c67ba9dcc20ef096700a335d23954908.jpg" alt="Katerwaul" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what some other people have had to say about Katerwaul:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Beguiling, impassioned and cinematic beauty integrated with fits of sheer sonic anarchy&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">THE FLY</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Soulful crashing loud choruses. Emotional heartfelt interludes&#8230; Refreshing, honest and vibrant. This is the soundtrack to one of life&#8217;s greatest Movies.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">***** ITUNES</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Live, Katerwaul are impassioned unpredictable and at times absorbing. They understand arrangements instinctively and swings from periods of loose and delicately interwoven delayed guitar arpeggios and gentle falsetto, to moments of crashing, distorted bass-and-drum driven chaos. And back again. At times frenzied, at others fragile; Katerwaul know when they should and &#8211; crucially &#8211; should not live up to their name.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">TREND MAGAZINE</p>
</blockquote>
