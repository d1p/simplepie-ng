src="http://creditshout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/American-Airlines-260x189.jpg" alt="" title="American-Airlines" width="260" height="189" class="photo" />If you fly on American Airlines frequently, you may be able to achieve Elite status in the American Airlines AAdvantage program. With such status comes upgrades and other travel rewards. How can you get Elite status with American Airlines AAdvantage? Let’s explore this and good ways to earn miles in the process.</p><p>To achieve elite status, you’ll have to earn at least 25,000 miles or fly on 30 flight segments. Miles can be earned by purchasing tickets on American Airlines, American Eagle, American Connection, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, Finnair, Horizon Air, Iberia, Japan Airlines (including J-Air, JAL Express,  JALways,  Japan Asia Airways and Japan Transocean Air), LAN Airlines (including LAN Argentina, LAN Ecuador, LAN Express and LAN Peru), Malev Hungarian Airlines, Mexicana, Quantas, Royal Jordanian, S7 and American Airlines marketed codeshare flights (if the ticket reflects an American Airlines coded flight number).</p><p>Once you’re hit 25,000 miles or 30 flight segments, you’ll achieve AAdvantage Gold Status. At 50,000 miles or 60 segments, you’ll achieve AAdvantage Platinum status. At 100,000 miles or 100 segments, you’ll achieve AAdvantage Executive Platinum status.</p><p><span
id="more-13254"></span><div
class="bigheader">Benefits</div><p>At AAdvantage Gold status, you will have access to complimentary upgrades on full-fare tickets within 24 hours of your flight. You’ll also have access to other upgrades such as companion upgrades. Additionally, you’ll receive the following benefits and more:</p><ul><li>25 percent Elite mileage bonus</li><li>Minimum mileage guarantee</li><li>Special service desk</li><li>Preferred seating</li><li>Priority check-in, security screening and boarding</li><li>Same-day standby</li><li>Waived checked baggage charge</li><li>Discounted Admirals Club membership</li><li>Waived award processing charge</li></ul><p>At AAdvantage Platinum status, you’ll receive the same benefits as with AAdvantage Gold and the following:</p><ul><li>Upgrades on full-fare tickets within 72 hours of your flight</li><li>100 percent Elite mileage bonus</li><li>Oneworld Partner Lounge access</li></ul><p>Once you hit AAdvantage Executive Platinum status, there is a big jump in rewards. In addition to all of the aforementioned awards, you’ll get the following:</p><ul><li>Unlimited complimentary upgrades</li><li>Up to 8 <a
href="http://www.aa.com/i18n/AAdvantage/eliteStatus/upgrades/upgrades.jsp" target="_blank">systemwide upgrades</a> per year (confirmed upgrades at the time of booking as opposed to hoping you’ll get an upgrade a few days before your flight)</li><li>Guaranteed economy class availability</li><li>Waitlist priority for purchased first or business-class tickets</li><li>Waived ticketing service charge</li><li><a
href="http://www.americanairlines.co.uk/i18n/travelInformation/newFlagship_Checkin.jsp?locale=en_GB&amp;anchorLocation=DirectURL&amp;title=ukflagshipcheck-in" target="_blank">Flagship Check-in</a> at London Heathrow Airport (an easier, less hectic way of checking in than the standard procedure)</li><li>Waived award charge</li><li>Expanded availability for reward seats</li></ul><p>As you can see, the benefits rise with each status level and you are more likely to get upgrades with each rise in status, as well.</p><div
class="bigheader">How to Get Upgrades</div><p>If you qualify for upgrades, you may wonder how to go about getting them. In order to get a systemwide upgrade (available for Executive Platinum status members), contact the Elite Service Desk and notify them that you’d like such an upgrade. This can be done at the time of booking or later.</p><p>For standard upgrades, call AAdvantage Reservations at 1-800-882-8880. These can also be requested at the time of booking. However, they will not be confirmed until the period in which they are eligible, such as within 72 hours of your flight for AAdvantage Platinum members.</p><div
class="bigheader">Earning Points with American Airlines</div><p>There are 2 credit cards that are specifically tailored toward American Airlines rewards. They are as follows:</p><p><strong>Citi Gold Select/AAdvantage World MasterCard</strong></p><p><div

href="http://creditshout.com/citi-gold-aadvantage-world-mastercard-review/" target="_blank">Citi Gold Select/AAdvantage World MasterCard</a> offers 30,000 AAdvantage bonus miles after $750 is spent within the first 4 months. It offers 1 mile per dollar spent on all purchases and a $50 statement credit for the first American Airlines purchase that is made within the first 12 months.</p><p>This card has a $50 annual fee. However, it has limitations such as a maximum of 6,000 miles that can be earned per year. So, for big spenders who are looking to gain Elite status and have less restrictions, the Citi Executive/AAdvantage card which I detail below offers more rewards, albeit at a higher price.</p><p><strong>Citi Executive/AAdvantage Card</strong></p><p>The Citi Executive/AAdvantage card comes with a $450 annual fee. It has no foreign transaction fee, which will be useful if you travel abroad frequently. It’s other fees are similar to those you’d find on most other credit cards.</p><p>Each year, after $40,000 is spent, you’ll receive 10,000 elite qualifying miles. Two miles per dollar spent are offered for American Airlines purchases and 1 mile per dollar spent is offered on other purchases.</p><p>Additionally, your first bag will be checked without charge when using this card and you’ll have access to the Admirals Club, which is basically an airport lounge. If you travel a lot, then the $450 annual fee may be worth it when considering all the miles that you can accumulate with this card.</p><p><div

Bank of America has announced plans to charge a $5 monthly debit card fee. This is yet another move among card issuers in response to the new regulations on swipe fees, which are expected to reduce revenue.</p><p>The fee will be levied on customers who have basic checking accounts. Customers must use the card to make purchases in order to incur the fee. Those who do not use a debit card or <a
href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/sep/29/bank-america-charge-5month-debit-cards/" target="_blank">only use it for ATM transactions</a> in a given month will not be charged the fee. Customers with premium checking accounts will not be charged the fee, as well.</p><p>The fee will be implemented in select states in January. The states to be affected first have yet to be announced.</p><p><span
id="more-13263"></span>Prior to Warren Buffet’s bailout of the company recently, they had significant <a
href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_19003931" target="_blank">setbacks</a>, perhaps adding to the desire for this fee. In addition to the new regulations, failed mortgages and lawsuits have eaten away at the company. Their stock has lost almost half of it’s value this year. Additionally, Bank of America announced plans to cut approximately 30,000 jobs.</p><p>So, if you have a Bank of America debit card that is tied to a basic checking account, you’ll have to pay a $5 monthly fee for anything in excess of ATM transactions. That comes out to $60 annually if you use it each month for purchases. That’s not the end of the world, but it’s another $60 down the drain in a tight economy &#8211; on top of declining rewards. Will you keep your Bank of America debit card or will you shop around for a better deal?</p><div
class="bigheader">How To Get Rid of The $5 Monthly Fee</div><p>In the past, many fees could be waved simply by contacting customer support, however something tells me that isn&#8217;t going to cut it with this new universal fee.</p><p>The first, most obvious answer is to just switch banks.  However I would actually hold off to see which banks end up implementing a debit card fee because of the new swipe fee regulations.  Bank of America wasn&#8217;t the first, and they won&#8217;t be the last to implement this new policy.</p><p>There is also the option of getting rid of your BOA debit card, while keeping your account.  Ditching your debit card completely may be a hard adjustment but it&#8217;s not impossible. You can pay your bills and online retailers by electronic check which is a great alternative to using a debit card.  Many popular online retailers <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=15399401">including Amazon support this feature</a>.  You can then use a credit card for all of the other purchases that you usually make with your debit card, and pay the card off in full each month with an electronic transfer from BOA.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is completely possible to live without a debit card, and with attractive rewards programs offered by cards like <a
href="http://creditshout.com/blue-cash-from-american-express-review/">American Express Blue Cash</a> and <a
href="http://creditshout.com/chase-freedom-credit-card-review/">Chase Freedom</a> you may even be better off.  If you do go the credit card route, just use the card responsibly and make sure to pay off your balance in full each month.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://creditshout.com/how-to-get-rid-of-the-bank-of-america-5-monthly-debit-card-fee/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>How To Get Companion Pass Status With Southwest Rapid Rewards</title><link>http://creditshout.com/how-to-get-companion-pass-status-with-southwest-rapid-rewards/</link> <comments>http://creditshout.com/how-to-get-companion-pass-status-with-southwest-rapid-rewards/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2011 20:54:32 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Clay Wyatt</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[General]]></category> <guid

Do you find yourself flying on the airline weekly &#8211; or even more? If so, you may be eligible for Companion Pass status.</p><div
class="bigheader">What is Companion Pass Status?</div><p>Companion Pass status means that a designated companion will fly for free for the remainder of the year in which this status is achieved and the entire following year. The companion must be 1 person, so you won’t be able to have a different companion fly for free each time. However, there is 1 caveat, as the companion may be changed up to 3 times during the period that the Companion Pass is valid. So, if you were hoping to fly to New York City with your spouse next week and then take your daughter to see Grandma in Florida in a few months, you could do so with a bit of effort. It will take some time to do so, as the request must be mailed to Southwest in writing along with the current pass. Note that, while the ticket is free for the companion, he or she may still incur a government-imposed security fee of up to $10 per round trip.</p><p><span
id="more-13248"></span>It is also important to note that no Rapid Rewards points will be given to your companion during flights in which your Companion Pass is used. While this may seem like a no-brainer, this could come into play if you were, say, hoping to score some free flights for your spouse who is also enrolled in the Rapid Rewards program. He or she could still fly free, but would not accumulate points in the process.</p><div
class="bigheader">How to Achieve Companion Pass Status</div><p>To achieve Companion Pass status, Rapid Rewards members must earn 110,000 qualifying points or fly 100 1-way flights in a calendar year. For purposes of this offer, a 1-way flight includes connecting flights. So, if you are flying from Cleveland to San Jose and stop in Los Angeles, you’ll get credit for 1 flight. If you fly back, you’ll then have a round trip for a total of 2 flights. You’ll have to fly 50 round trips to qualify for this offer, so this is geared toward frequent flyers.</p><p>Once you’ve hit the points or flights threshold, Southwest Airlines will mail you a postcard notifying you of your eligibility. At this point, you may send in the information regarding your companion. After your companion is designated, you’ll received your <a

href="http://creditshout.com/go/chase-southwest-plus">Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card from Chase</a> is a safe bet. It offers 2 points per dollar spent on all Southwest Airlines purchases. It also offers 2 points per dollar spent on purchases with Southwest Rapid Rewards hotel and vehicle rental partners. All other purchases earn 1 point per dollar spent.</p><p>In addition to the mentioned points, cardholders will receive 3,000 points on each membership anniversary. That is a $50 value on your next Southwest Airlines ticket. Additionally, a complimentary flight is offered after the first purchase (subject to a security fee of up to $10). So, you’ll have a flight on the house during your first year and $50 towards a flight each year thereafter &#8211; all while racking up points for more rewards.</p><p>This card comes with an annual fee of $69. It’s other fees are similar to those found on most other credit cards.</p><p>So, if you already spend a bunch of money on Southwest tickets, you’ll earn double points with this card. The points can be redeemed for various travel rewards or can be used to achieve Companion Pass status. Either way, you’ll be rewarded for your travel.</p><p><div

If so, you may be able to qualify for Elite status with the airline.</p><p>Doing so offers rewards such as upgrades and premium seating. In order to do so, you’ll have to earn at least 25,000 Premier Qualifying Miles (PQM) or 30 Premier Qualifying Segments (PQS).  Let’s take a look at how you can achieve Elite Status and what it could mean for you.</p><div
class="bigheader">How to Earn PQM and PQS</div><p>Generally, PQM and PQS are earned by flying on United Airlines flights and/or those of other Star Alliance airlines. If you are flying on another Star Alliance airline, check with United Airlines prior to booking your flight, as some offer only partial PQM/PQS and others do not earn any at all.</p><p>When determining how many PQS you will earn (on flights in which they are offered), a segment is a portion of the total trip. If you have 2 flights on your trip, you’ll earn 2 segments. So, if you fly from Miami to Minneapolis with a stop in Chicago, you’ll earn 2 PQS. If you fly the same route back, you’ll earn a total of 4 PQS.</p><p><span

style="clear: both;"></div></div></div> The <a
href="http://creditshout.com/united-mileageplus-explorer-card-review/" >Mileage Plus Explorer card</a> comes with no annual fee in the first year and $95 thereafter. It’s other fees are similar to most other credit cards. With this card, customers will earn 25,000 bonus miles after the first purchases. Then, if another account holder is added within the first 2 months, another 5,000 bonus miles will be given. Another 10,000 bonus miles are offered after $25,000 is spent each year. So, customers could earn up to 40,000 bonus miles in the first year with this card.</p><p>Other than the higher bonus miles, the rewards with this card are virtually the same as those on the business version. If you are an individual who prefers to fly on United Airlines or related airlines, then this is a good card to have if you are in the market for a new credit card &#8211; or just want to earn a bunch of rewards.</p><p><strong>MileagePlus Explorer Business Card</strong></p><p>The <a
href="https://www.theexplorercard.com/MPBusiness35kAFW.aspx?CELL=NW1&amp;navSource=MP-Pool&amp;linkTitle=PTN_VisaExplorerBusiness_upto35k_XXCards_NW1_20110719" target="_blank">MileagePlus Explorer Business card</a> offers 25,000 bonus points after your first use. Additionally, after $25,000 is spent each year, 10,000 bonus miles are given. There is no annual fee with this card in the first year and it is $95 thereafter. The remaining <a
href="http://www.firstusa.com/cgi-bin/webcgi/webserve.cgi?page_type=appterms&amp;card=DJLZ" target="_blank">fees</a> are typical of other credit cards out there.</p><p>This card also offers 2 miles per dollar spent on United and Continental Airlines tickets. It also offers double miles on purchases of office supplies, gasoline and dining. Customers and a companion may check 1 bag at no charge on each flight when using this card. There are plenty of other benefits, so this is a great card to have if you are a frequent flyer on United Airlines.</p><div
class="bigheader">What Your PQM/PQS Will Get You</div><p>Once you’ve earned 25,000 PQM or 30 PQS, you will qualify for Elite status. Below are the thresholds that you must hit to achieve each level of Elite status. Note that these will be the names of the statuses starting in 2012:</p><ul><li>Premier Silver &#8211; 25,000 PQM or 30 PQS</li><li>Premier Gold &#8211; 50,000 PQM or 60 PQS</li><li>Premier Platinum &#8211; 75,000 PQM or 90 PQS</li><li>Premier 1K &#8211; 100,000 PQM or 120 PQS</li></ul><p>Basically, if you fly at least 25,000 miles on United Airlines or fly 15 round-trips (less if you have connecting flights), then you’ll qualify for Elite status.</p><p>All status levels will give you access to dedicated call center lines and the following:</p><ul><li>Ability to book Economy Plus tickets at no extra charge for you and a companion</li><li>Unlimited domestic upgrades (chances of being cleared improve at each gain in status)</li><li>Red Carpet Club access (an airport lounge with television, wi-fi, etc. &#8211; costs $375 to $700 per year depending on your status and if you have a guest)</li><li>Minimum of 500 miles earned per UA or UX flight</li><li>Ability to redeem miles for vehicle rentals, merchandise and hotel stays</li></ul><p>Additionally, you’ll get more benefits as you rise in status. For example, while having Premier Silver status will allow you to have 1 bag of up to 50 pounds checked without a fee, every other level allows for 3 bags of up to 70 pounds each. The higher levels also offer discounts on in-flight shopping of 10 percent (Platinum and 1K). In general, you’ll receive all of the mentioned rewards for achieving Elite status and will gain more as you reach each level.</p><p><div

You’ve flown on Delta for a  while now and are accumulating Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) quickly. Once you hit certain threshold amounts with your MQMs, you will be entitled to various benefits, including complimentary seat upgrades. How do you go about doing so?</p><p>In order to qualify for complimentary upgrades, you’ll have to accumulate at least 25,000 MQMs. At this point, you will achieve Silver Medallion Status. As the typical Delta flight earns at least 500 MQMs (even if you travel less than that in actual miles), you should be able to reach this amount fairly quickly if you are frequent flyer. Many are multiplied by 1.5, so you’d actually receive, for example, 3,000 MQMs if you traveled 2,000 miles. At that rate, you’d hit 25,000 MQMs in just over eight round trips. <span
id="more-13201"></span></p><p>Here is the breakdown of the <a
href="http://www.delta.com/skymiles/about_skymiles/benefits_at_glance/upgrades/index.jsp" target="_blank">remaining thresholds and statuses</a>:</p><ul><li>50,000 MQMs &#8211; Gold Medallion Status</li><li>75,000 MQMs &#8211; Platinum Medallion Status</li><li>125,000 MQMs &#8211; Diamond Medallion Status</li></ul><p>Once you reach Silver Medallion Status, you will qualify for unlimited upgrades. Of course, the perks get better as your status rises, so you’ll stand to benefit more by moving up the ranks. Here is how upgrades are prioritized (all but priority 1 apply to class B, M, H, Q, K, L, U, T and E tickets) :</p><ul><li>Priority 1: All Medallion flyers on Y-class fares are cleared for upgrades at the time of ticketing</li><li>Priority 2: Diamond Medallion  flyers are cleared for upgrades 5 days prior to their flights</li><li>Priority 3: Platinum Medallion flyers are cleared for upgrades 5 days prior to their flights</li><li>Priority 4: Gold Medallion flyers are cleared for upgrades 3 days prior to their flights</li><li>Priority 5: Silver Medallion flyers are cleared 1 day prior to their flights</li><li>Priority 6: Companions are cleared within 24 hours of departure</li></ul><p>In addition, those paying with award tickets or the Pay with Miles program are given priority at each level after Diamond Medallion flyers are cleared. In other words, after Diamond Medallion flyers are cleared for their upgrades, those paying with award tickets or the Pay with Miles program are cleared next and this process repeats in steps 3 and 4 with the Platinum and Gold Medallions, respectively. Your chances of getting cleared for an upgrade decrease at each priority, so you’ll have a much better chance at getting an upgrade with Diamond Medallion Status than with Silver Medallion Status.</p><p>So, once you earn at least 25,000 MQMs, you’ll be eligible for complimentary upgrades with the Delta SkyMiles program. While I wouldn’t recommend going out and taking a bunch of random flights just to reach this amount, it will be a nice benefit if you fly enough to achieve it anyway. Of course, availability of seat upgrades is also an issue, so Diamond Medallion Status doesn’t mean you’ll be rubbing elbows with celebrities and corporate big-shots on every flight &#8211; and, even if you do sit next to them, you won‘t have to rub elbows with them in your comfortable seat! However, you will be able to fly more comfortably on some flights, which isn’t a bad perk to have if you’re in the air a lot.</p><p><div

src="http://creditshout.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chase-132x150.jpg" alt="" title="chase" width="132" height="150" class="photo" /></a>Over the years we have received quite a few complaints alleging that Chase Payment Protector is a scam. The complaints generally centered around deceptive practices by Chase in getting customers to sign up for this service and Chase‘s reluctance to honor it. The complaints usually state that it was rather difficult to get this service cancelled after it was added to an account, taking months in some cases. So, is Chase Payment Protector a Scam? Let’s take a look at what it is and whether or not it is, in fact, a scam.</p><div
class="bigheader">Chase Payment Protector Overview</div><p>Chase Payment Protector is a service that Chase offers to it’s customers. This service allows customers to suspend payments for up to two years without incurring interest or plan fees. Of course, this isn’t free, so Chase charges customers $0.89 per $100 balance. Customers are only charged if there is a balance left over, so customers who pay in full will not incur the $0.89 fee for Chase Payment Protector.</p><p>This service is geared toward customers who have serious life events. Payments can be suspended for up to 4 months for events such as marriage and the birth of a child. Payments can be suspended for up to two years for events such as the loss of employment or disability. <span
id="more-13177"></span></p><div
class="bigheader">Why Some Say It Is a Scam</div><p>In line with the mentioned complaints, customers (and lawsuits) have alleged that Chase does not honor the plan. A <a
href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/07/14/Class_Claims_Chase_Payment_Plan_is_a_Scam.htm" target="_blank">2009 lawsuit</a> claimed that Chase cancelled accounts and performed other unscrupulous activities in order to demand payment from their customers. In general, it seems that a lot of customers have not had a good experience with this service and felt that they were unfairly manipulated by Chase.</p><p>Let’s suppose that you are President of the Chase Fan Club and jump at all of their offers. You see this and think that it is effectively an interest rate of 0.89 percent. Not a bad deal, right?</p><p>Chase Payment Protector only applies to future purchases. Suppose you lose your job a month after signing up for this service. You’ll still owe any money that is past due or over the credit limit that you incurred before this event and have to pay interest and normal fees on it &#8211; plus 89 cents per month for this plan.</p><p>The benefit is that you can incur new purchases without paying interest on them immediately. Suppose you become strapped for cash (due to your unemployment) and have to keep the water running and the table full of food. You can charge these expenses to your credit card and pay $0.89 per $100 &#8211; instead of your normal interest rate. The $0.89 will be much lower than your interest rate (if you are not in a 0 percent introductory period), so you’ll make out better there, at least temporarily. However, you’ll have to pay it back in a set period of time or you’ll be paying interest on those purchases, which is the last thing you will want to do if you remain unemployed.</p><p>If you can pay the balance off within the stated timeframe (2 years, 4 months, etc.), then you’d be much better off with the Chase Payment Protector plan than if you charged expenses and incurred interest. Otherwise, you’ll be paying 89 cents plus interest, making you a little worse off.</p><div
class="bigheader">Should You Consider Signing Up For Chase Payment Protector?</div><p>If you live a stable life and are financially secure, there is not much of a reason to sign up for this plan. It’ll probably be 1 more hassle for you if you happen to miss a payment 1 month, even though it’ll only cost 89 cents. The reason is because of the difficulty that some have reported in getting it cancelled &#8211; meaning you may have to make a long call (or more) to a customer service representative to cancel it.</p><p>If you think that there is a decent chance that you’ll have a major life event (birth of a child, job loss, etc.) in the foreseeable future, then this could work out in your favor. However, if you are strapped for cash to the point that you would spend on your card without paying it back in the short term, then you should probably hold off on your plans (child birth, etc.) or save up more money before it happens. Essentially, there should be no reason for you to sign up for this service, as you should take the necessary steps to achieve a more secure financial life if you anticipate needing it in the first place.</p><p>When we think of scams, we often think of a shady telemarketer stealing our credit card numbers or a phishing email. In that sense, this is not a scam.</p><p>However, with reports of customers who were essentially tricked into signing up for Chase Payment Protector and others who had it added without their consent, it points towards shady business practices. This is not to say that Chase as a whole is a bad company &#8211; or is great &#8211; but, on this issue, they seem to have really dropped the ball. It is probably best to just shy away from this service that Chase offers &#8211; and check your bill for unauthorized charges if you have a Chase card!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://creditshout.com/is-chase-payment-protector-a-scam/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Payment Protection Class Action Lawsuits</title><link>http://creditshout.com/payment-protection-class-action-lawsuits/</link> <comments>http://creditshout.com/payment-protection-class-action-lawsuits/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 17:57:16 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Clay Wyatt</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[General]]></category> <guid

Most of us know about the new regulations, but there have also been a series of lawsuits regarding so-called payment protection plans. Has your credit card provider been hit with such a lawsuit? Let’s take a look at a few of those that have.</p><div
class="bigheader">Capital One</div><p>In January of 2010, a <a
href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2010/01/capital_one_suit.html" target="_blank">class action lawsuit was filed against Capital One</a> in the US District Court for the Southern District of California. The lawsuit alleged that Capital One did not disclose the terms properly, had severe restrictions on the plan’s benefits and made it very difficult for consumers to get their benefits. Also, Capital One was accused of pushing this plan onto consumers via direct marketing or without their consent.</p><p>Capital one settled this lawsuit late in 2010 and consumers were offered $15 to $63 for their troubles. The amount given depended on the consumer’s dealings with the company. <span
id="more-13183"></span></p><div
class="bigheader">HSBC</div><p>Earlier this year, HSBC was hit with a payment protection plan lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that HSBC enrolled customers in the plan without notice. It also alleged that HSBC solicited retirees, the disabled and others who did not qualify for benefits under the plan. Like the Capital One lawsuit, HSBC was also accused of making it very difficult to realize any benefits under the plan. Additionally, HSBC was accused of making it difficult for customers to cancel the plan.</p><div
class="bigheader">Discover</div><p>In December of 2010, a class action lawsuit was filed against Discover in Minnesota. A similar lawsuit was also filed in Tennessee during that month. The culprit in each case &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; was a payment protection plan.</p><p>Each lawsuit alleged deceptive business practices by Discover in regard to their payment protection plan. The Minnesota case claimed that consumers were tricked and did not even know that they signed up. It was estimated that Minnesota residents were charged tens of millions of dollars during this alleged scam.</p><div
class="bigheader">Chase</div><p>As has been reported on this site, Chase was subject to a payment protection lawsuit. Customers were sent checks of $20 and were automatically enrolled in the plan if they cashed them.</p><p>It seems that the credit card industry has been riddled with cases of payment protection scams in recent years. It is a tell-tale sign of corruption within the industry. However, this does not mean that all credit card companies are practicing such deceptive behavior. Your best bet is to review your statements regularly to ensure that you understand all of the charges on there. If there is something that you do not understand, contact the company for an explanation and, if you feel that you are being ripped off, get it cancelled or consider switching credit card providers. Oh, and if you get a check in the mail that you did not earn, chances are that there are strings attached. Don’t cash it until you’ve thoroughly investigated it!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://creditshout.com/payment-protection-class-action-lawsuits/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Good Frequent Flyer Mile Calculators</title><link>http://creditshout.com/good-frequent-flyer-mile-calculators/</link> <comments>http://creditshout.com/good-frequent-flyer-mile-calculators/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 17:48:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Clay Wyatt</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[General]]></category> <guid

If you take a 5,000 mile round trip, you’ll get 5,000 miles. Of course, there are double miles and other bonuses to consider, but that is the gist of things. Want to calculate them on your own? Let’s explore a few calculators that you can use to do so.</p><div
class="bigheader">TravelMath Calculator</div><p><a
href="http://www.travelmath.com/flight-distance/" target="_blank">This calculator</a> is great for those who want a simple calculator without all the bells and whistles. You enter in your origin and destination and press “Calculate.” It then gives you the distance of your trip, which you can multiply by two on any simple calculator if you are going round trip. There is also plenty of other information that you can look up easily with this calculator, such as the nearest airport, flight time and several other bits of information. It’s not the most advanced calculator out there, but it will give you a good idea of how many frequent flyer miles you’ll earn without having to enter your life story. <span
id="more-13172"></span></p><div
class="bigheader">USA Today Calculator</div><p>USA Today’s calculator is a bit more advanced than the TravelMath calculator. This will be great if you are looking to get to the nuts and bolts of things instead of just getting a broad picture. It gives the option of adding up to three destinations. <a
href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/miles/calculator.htm" target="_blank">This calculator</a> takes the following categories into consideration and gives you the amount of miles that you can expect to earn:</p><ul><li>Distance</li><li>Elite bonus</li><li>Class of service bonus</li><li>Special promotion bonus</li></ul><p>Note that all of these categories also have the option of being based on actual or minimum miles.</p><p>So, let’s say that you are flying from New York to California on business and plan to stop in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Of course, you’ll fly back to New York as well, adding plenty of miles to your trip &#8211; although the weather in L.A. may make you think twice about it. Also, let’s assume that you qualify for double miles as a special promotion bonus. Your results will be as follows:</p><ul><li>Total roundtrip distance &#8211; 10,776 miles</li><li>Bonus miles &#8211; 10,780 miles</li><li>Total frequent flyer miles &#8211; 21,556 miles</li></ul><p>As you can see, this calculator gives much more detail than the Travelmath calculator, giving you a more in-depth picture of your situation if you’d like to go that route.</p><div
class="bigheader">Airline-Specific Calculators</div><p>Going with an airline-specific calculator is the best bet if your airline has 1. Some airlines offer online calculators that give results specific to their airline.</p><p>Continental Airlines has such a <a
href="http://www.continental.com/CMS/en-US/Marketing/CustComm/Promotions/Pages/continental.aspx" target="_blank">calculator</a>. It is fairly straightforward. You go to the calculator, enter your origin and destination, enter your trip type and ticket type, then your status (non-elite, silver elite, etc.). Within seconds, you’ll know how many frequent flyer miles you’ll get and it comes straight from the horse’s mouth.</p><p>United Airlines also has a frequent flyer miles <a
href="http://www.united.com/page/article/1,,53601,00.html?linkTracking=MMax_EarnMiles" target="_blank">calculato</a>r. Theirs is more advanced than Continental Airlines’ calculator and takes not only flight miles into consideration, but other spending so that you may determine how many miles you can get. It takes travel, shopping and money management expenses into consideration. Take note that your results will probably be less accurate than those that Continental gives, as this calculator offers what you could earn, not necessarily what you will earn.</p><p>Other airlines offer such calculators, as well. Check your favorite airline’s website to see if they offer a frequent flyer miles calculator.</p><p>The mentioned calculators can all be found on the Internet and won’t cost you a dime to use. There are also applications that are available on mobile phones, but you may have to pay for those. It all depends on how many bells and whistles you are looking for. If you’re looking for something very simple, then go with TravelMath’s calculator. If you want something very advanced, then you’ll probably have to pay for it. In any event, the mentioned calculators should do just fine for most people, so give them a try if you would like to know how many frequent flyer miles you could earn!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://creditshout.com/good-frequent-flyer-mile-calculators/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>How To Get Cash Back on Amazon Purchases</title><link>http://creditshout.com/how-to-get-cash-back-on-amazon-purchases/</link> <comments>http://creditshout.com/how-to-get-cash-back-on-amazon-purchases/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2011 15:52:15 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Clay Wyatt</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[General]]></category> <guid

If you like to use their site, you could easily spend hundreds &#8211; maybe thousands &#8211; of dollars there each year on your favorite items and gifts for others. Why not earn some cash back on those purchases? Let’s take a look at some ways in which you can earn cash back on Amazon.com purchases.</p><div

href="http://creditshout.com/go/amex-blue-cash">Blue Cash Everyday(SM) Card from American Express</a> cardholders. As such, customers will earn 2 percent cash back on any purchase they make through Amazon. This card also has no caps or tiers to worry about.</p><p>In addition to giving you 2 percent back on Amazon purchases, you can earn 3% cash back at supermarkets and 2% back on gas and at other department stores and 1% back on all other purchases.  The flexible rewards program is what makes this card our preferred way to earn cash back on most of our purchases, including those on Amazon.</p><p><span

href="http://creditshout.com/go/amex-blue-cash">Blue Cash Everyday(SM) Preferred Card from American Express</a>. The perks are better with the Blue Cash Preferred card, as such purchases earn 3 percent cash back.</p><p>If you don’t have the Blue Cash and/or the Blue Cash Preferred card at this time and you plan to use it primarily for Amazon.com purchases, you’d probably be better off by going with the Blue Cash card. This is because this card has no annual fee while the Blue Cash Preferred card has a $75 annual fee.</p><p>You’d have to spend $2,500 at Amazon.com just to cover the annual fee on the Blue Cash Preferred card &#8211; a point at which you’d already have $50 in cash back with the Blue Cash card. However, if you are looking for a card that will also be beneficial on supermarket and gasoline purchases, then the Blue Cash Preferred card offers higher percentages in those categories (6% cash back at supermarkets and 3% back on gas), so for people who spend enough, it can actually be well worth the annual fee.</p><div

href="http://creditshout.com/go/discover-more-review">Discover® More Card</a> offers 2 percent cash back on Amazon.com purchases that are made this month (September of 2011). If you’re planning to shop on Amazon.com soon and you have this card, consider making your purchase by the end of the month. There is a $250 spending limit on the 2 percent cash back offer, so you’ll earn 1 percent on amounts that are spent in excess of this.</p><p>Earlier this month when Discover first announced they were offering bonus cash back at Amazon I was actually excited.  However if you do the math, you can only earn $5 in cash back rewards on Amazon before being bumped down to the 1% tier with this card. Hopefully most people will see that this is essentially just a big marketing gimmick, and decide to pass.</p><div
class="bigheader">Amazon.com Rewards Visa: 3% Cash Back</div><p>The <a
href="http://creditshout.com/amazon-credit-card-review/" target="_blank">Amazon.com Rewards Visa</a> offers 3 points per dollar spent on Amazon.com purchases. If you redeem 2,500 points, you’ll get a $25 Amazon.com gift card. Once you hit 5,000 points, you’ll have many more rewards options, including gas station gift cards and, as you get higher in points, you’ll be eligible to redeem your points for travel rewards.</p><p>This isn’t a bad deal if you are exclusively looking for a card to make your Amazon.com purchases with, as it effectively earns 3 cents on the dollar. However, if you want a more comprehensive card that has more rewards and flexibility, then the Blue Cash and the Blue Cash Preferred cards are much better options.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://creditshout.com/how-to-get-cash-back-on-amazon-purchases/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>How to Keep Frequent Flyer Miles From Expiring</title><link>http://creditshout.com/how-to-keep-frequent-flyer-miles-from-expiring/</link> <comments>http://creditshout.com/how-to-keep-frequent-flyer-miles-from-expiring/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 17:50:57 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Clay Wyatt</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[General]]></category> <guid

Now, you’re just sitting on them &#8211; waiting for a reason to use them. Maybe you’re planning a vacation or maybe just a trip to your hometown. Whatever the case may be, they won’t last forever if you are not careful. How long will they last? How do you keep your frequent flyer miles from expiring?</p><p>The lifetime of frequent flyer miles depends on which airline they are with. Most frequent flyer miles <a
href="http://www.smartertravel.com/travel-advice/advtips/advice.php?id=16736" target="_blank">expire in 1 to 2 years</a>. Jet Blue is at the low end of this spectrum with a 1 year expiration on it’s miles while Southwest is at the high end with a 24 month expiration on it’s miles. The exception to this is Continental Airlines, as their miles do not expire.</p><p>Using the credit card that is affiliated with the frequent flyer miles will keep your miles active. Even if you have decided to ditch that card, it could be beneficial to link up a monthly bill to it to keep the miles active. Alternatively, you could buy a cup of coffee, a song on the Internet, a pack of gum or some other relatively inexpensive item each month on your card. If you’re already using your card, then you won’t have to worry about losing your miles with most airlines.</p><p><span
id="more-13169"></span>If you’re not ready to fly yet, but don’t want to lose those miles, consider earning miles through an affiliated company of the airline that you use. Such companies include vehicle rental companies, hotels and/or any other type of company that your card gives miles for. Be sure to check with your provider for other ways to earn miles &#8211; and thereby keep your current miles from expiring.</p><p>If your frequent flyer miles have expired, you <a
href="http://travel.usatoday.com/deals/inside/2010-08-26-frequent-flier-miles-expiration_N.htm" target="_blank">may be able to get them back</a>. Some airlines will reinstate your miles if they expire. However, doing so comes at a fee. Some charge a flat fee and others charge a fee per mile and a processing fee. Determine whether or not you’d make out better by leaving your miles expired or paying to reinstate them, as you may have to pay up to several hundred dollars to do so &#8211; which can be more than they are worth in some cases.</p><p>By planning ahead, you should be able to avoid losing your frequent flyer miles. Check with your provider for the expiration date on your miles and ways in which you can keep them alive. Also, consider switching to a better frequent flyer program if yours isn’t working well for you. Racking up a load of miles isn’t going to do you much good if they tend to expire before you use them. So, stay on top of your frequent flyer miles to avoid losing them, as you’ll have to pay for your next flight out of pocket if you don’t!</p><p><div
