<p>I understand the need for fusion on some level</p>

<p>Maybe I do not need to know why or how.</p>
<p>I just need to be the best embodiment of those parts.</p>

Not because I believed in the policy direction or in the leadership of this party but because I did not believe any other party had anything else to offer. David Cameron made me mad every time I saw him in the run up to the election with his sleeves rolled up!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was not surprised by the outcome but am afraid of what a Conservative/Liberal Democrats coalition means for a country lacking in serious leadership. I think that the indecisive public went to the polls wanting to be inspired by the leadership having previously watched a paradigm being created and inspiration deliver a black man as president in the USA. There was no inspiration, except in the numbers that were engaged and how the electorate sought to turn politics on its head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so today we have a coalition.</p>
<p>Where are our inspirational leaders or leaders who are not obsessed with their own rise?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hopeful that today's decision is just the beginning. The beginning for a more responsive electorate concerned with its outcome and not by the spin of current political leaders.</p>

Today has been one of those days.</p>
<p>I woke after a fretful night to plans for treating myself to clothes and books and my first movie at the LLGFF. After a long difficult telephone conversation, I decided to cycle into angel which I did with much childlike glee along the regents canal. The weather over the last few days has lifted my spirits immensely.</p>
<p>Shopping wasn't a great success but just pleasing my own whims of moving around london from Angel onto the Southbank on my hardy steed was just what my spirit called for. &nbsp;At Southbank I bumped into people I knew and chatted about something and nothing. The film was about finding love and a death. It was OK.</p>
<p>When the screeching of others is irking and the demands on me knock hard on each surface I can learn to let them be.</p>
<p>Welcome to Spring.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>She's Back and Constant</title><id>http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2010/3/2/shes-back-and-constant.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2010/3/2/shes-back-and-constant.html"/><author><name>Georgina George</name></author><published>2010-03-02T20:43:50Z</published><updated>2010-03-02T20:43:50Z</updated><content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB"><![CDATA[<p>Over a year later and I am back.</p>
<p>Back to reinventing the blog and the creative outpouring that is me and my life. Phew! How do I catch up on a year? Maybe I don't and I just start here. Yes that feels right. Right now I am listening to the Sugarcubes who I used to love; &nbsp;fronted by a younger Bjork and remembering back to a time when I explored vinyl and new mostly independent artists. I don't do that so much now but Spotify helps alot in nostalgic moments. And this is one of them.</p>
<p>I can briefly sum up the past year. I have stayed well and healthy and loving life despite its uncertainty and upheaval which has been a constant it seems for 2 years at least. I found a voice, a creative right hand a now resting supper club, a love of hot yoga which has both the ability to make me want to cry and laugh at the same time and an ability to stay optimistic about life. Great.</p>
<p>For the now, I want to keep those things constant.</p>

What can I say?</p>
<p>I have painted a couple of canvasses, written a prose piece for a new writing group started by my lover. I am in the middle of knitting a stripy scarf. My mum has been to St Lucia and back. I stood in&nbsp;for her on her&nbsp;job (as I still don't have one) and I thoroughly enjoyed it!!! There has been synchronicity but no great sign posts but the synchronicity works. I hate Fridays' because it means and has meant the agencies haven't found me any work (I am an eternal optimist though, and am completely committed to the 6 agencies I have now registered with!). I am learning to live with&nbsp;my hate.</p>
<p>In painting my current canvas I am&nbsp;discovering that I can paint&nbsp;and in painting tell a story. I am&nbsp;loving the discovery. The canvas is a painting based on a&nbsp;photograph I took on a rainy Pride day in New York this Summer - rainbows everywhere. I suppose I am still trying to reclaim my 3 months in&nbsp;New 'Isn't It Fantastic'&nbsp;York tragedy and one of those ways appears to be in painting scenes from&nbsp;those Summer months.&nbsp;I did try and get a list going of the good things coming out of that trip (see an earlier posting) - here's no. 4 I think?!</p>
<p>I have read about 5 books since I last posted and probably have watched the same number of&nbsp;old movies. I think Ghost and Angels of America (movies) rank the best; Whoopi makes me laugh out loud (on my own) and thats a rarity these days, (From Ghost she's in the bank in that ridiculous outfit when she is told how much is in the account she is about to close - hilarious!) Angels in America is just beautiful - I burst into tears at the impassioned confession of fear that the man dying of aids discloses to his lover about his likely death&nbsp;and Emma Thompson as the down and out is fascinating as is Meryl Streep as the mother of the closet gay mormon who in the scene with the down and out&nbsp;is lost and wants to know how to get to Brooklyn - fabulous! I reccommend both films for recovery!</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Probably?...Maybe?... Ok Yes!

Each day was like battle days. Mostly I think it was just readjusting but boy was it ugly! Now Peace reigns in the house.

Yesterday I felt like I missed New York but I wasn't sure that I was just missing the weather and the unreality of being 'placed' there compared now with the reality of life and the credit crunch! I feel like I am in some sort of cocoon though. Mostly its self imposed; 3 months in another country and culture takes a lot of adjusting to. Allowing myself to find a rhythm&nbsp;for my days back at home has been important and indulging - its too easy to become busy with life and I just don't want to. I do have the fortune of not having to work - for the moment&nbsp;anyway.</P>
<P>I was ready to come home knowing that there is work undone from my first visit and stay in the states and armed with a plan for returning I was pleased to leave.</P>
<P>I spent my first week confused. Wide awake in the majical hours of 4am reading up on week old news and feeling pleased that I was at odds with the rest of a (mostly) sleepy London. </P>
<P>I love being back amongst the colour of my posessions and the frequent laughter of my beautiful lover. Meeting up with friends to celebrate a major birthday when I wasn't feeling remotely like celebrating but wanting to mark its passage somehow ended up being appropriate and fun.</P>
<P>My plans are being endorsed which is wonderful and so&nbsp;I am looking toward Spring 09 with less pressure and much anticipation. I am kinda looking for work but not too hard - although doing nothing is hard! (shh don't tell anyone!)</P>
<P>I am working on a list of positives from my trip but even writing this confirms how not easy this is - I am an optimist though...</P>
<P>1. I successfully lived in New York for 3 months</P>
<P>2. I started this blog and started writing regularly</P>
<P>3. Meeting Stella on Brit soil on Monday was sublime </P>
<P>4. I now know what I want to do with my immediate future which is to return to the US and try and make a life there...</P>
<P>and thats the list so far....</P>
<P>Glad to be back quietly!</P>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Simple Pleasures</title><id>http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2008/8/19/simple-pleasures.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2008/8/19/simple-pleasures.html"/><author><name>Georgina George</name></author><published>2008-08-19T02:49:40Z</published><updated>2008-08-19T02:49:40Z</updated><content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB"><![CDATA[Siitting by and splashing in the pool in Central Park.]]></content></entry><entry><title>Closure</title><id>http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2008/7/31/closure.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2008/7/31/closure.html"/><author><name>Georgina George</name></author><published>2008-07-31T22:34:36Z</published><updated>2008-07-31T22:34:36Z</updated><content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't had words or whole sentences that can fully express what the last 2 weeks have been like for me here in New York as my time on the programme comes to an end. Suffice to say I have struggled with my feelings. I&nbsp;have been facing the closure of this transformational period of my life with fear. Facing questions about closing doors and unremarkable episodes of time (i think) in a foreign place. And the light going out on a dream.</p>
<p>Today I think I have adjusted to the nature of those feelings; I am accepting them as they are, not knowing what they mean and not able to fight them anymore. I have had revealing conversations with people at a time when I have no idea what relevance they will play&nbsp;now or in the future or&nbsp;if at all. It just is and I wait to see what evolves.</p>
<p>Thank you L for your sturdiness when I am just a plain wreck.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title>Transition</title><id>http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2008/7/31/transition.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://quietlykeep.squarespace.com/blog/2008/7/31/transition.html"/><author><name>Georgina George</name></author><published>2008-07-31T22:24:30Z</published><updated>2008-07-31T22:24:30Z</updated><content type="html" xml:lang="en-GB"><![CDATA[<P>Providence is what you get. </P>
