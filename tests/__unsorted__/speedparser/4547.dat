			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="clear: both"><a class="image-link" href="http://www.littlename.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/fk200708_12-full.jpg"><img class="linked-to-original" style=" text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 10px;" src="http://www.littlename.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/fk200708_12-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="250" /></a><br />
To be emotionally honest is tough. To be strong enough not to pretend when something hurts you that it actually doesnt takes more guts than not to. Its so easy to lie &amp; say that your emotions have not been touched by someone elses actions. Its easier to tell everyone you&#8217;re ok than to admit youve been crushed by the words or deeds of another.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
So this is why so many of us do it: the avoidance of pain. But with a strength or a purpose to admit that humanity, by nature, is emotionally frail &amp; that I, myself, am human and therefore frail you can never lose yourself. You may feel acute embarrassment. You may feel crushed by the pain that has been done to you but through all that you still know who you are. Never wavering from it. After all, it is ourselves who it is most easy to lie to. Others can see through it so often &amp; so easily but we fall for our own lies everytime. Because we want to.<br />
<br />&nbsp;<br />
Ridicule may be a powerful weapon but so is emotional intelligence and losing the sense of who we are is much worse. From one you may escape the other can be permanent.</p>
