			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The final showdown in Afghanistan has begun. There is a consensus that this was inevitable. A clash of interests between the US and Pakistan in an Afghanistan where multiple stakeholders were desperately competing for power was bound to end like a game of Monopoly – in a quarrel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan will not stop sheltering or supporting, or at least not pick a fight with a long-time ally that is likely to have influence in Afghanistan in future, for another long-time ally that is about to leave Afghanistan for good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But that is not the argument the military has made in front of its people. Whether it is a good strategy to invest on the Haqqani Network rather than in the economy of the new Kabul is a separate debate. But that debate is not taking place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national narrative is this: The world is conspiring against Pakistan. Its sovereignty is being violated, its people are being killed, and its economy is being hurt in the US war on terror, and the world still keeps asking Pakistan to &#8216;do more&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deception is an important part of war and international negotiation, especially for a country like Pakistan that is negotiating from a weak position. But manipulating public opinion to the extent of paranoia and hysteria, to promote a &#8216;besieged fortress&#8217; mentality is not a good idea. The army may get what it wants in Afghanistan in the end, but it risks doing so at the cost of becoming another Afghanistan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some popular &#8216;public opinion&#8217; myths must be re-examined:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) That Pakistan was always the primary target because real US interests lie not in Afghanistan but in Pakistan: That is not probable because the US could not have spent more than a trillion dollars on a embarrassing 10-year war in Afghanistan as an excuse to gradually destabilise and deweaponise Pakistan, when it could have done the same directly, right after 9/11 with the world rallying behind it, with less cost and in less time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) The US is violating Pakistan&#8217;s sovereignty: When the US hinted at a direct strike in North Waziristan, among the first people who vowed to respond was Sirajuddin Haqqani. He said the US would suffer more casualties in North Waziristan than it did in Afghanistan. When Haqqani was vowing to defend the tribal agency, Pakistan Army was saying it does not have the capacity to move in. How can Pakistan lay claim on a territory it admits it cannot control?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) That terrorism started after 9/11: Of the 35,000 innocent people killed in Pakistan since the war on terror began, less than one percent were killed in US drone strikes. The rest were killed by a) terrorist groups and sectarian militias who had sanctuaries in Pakistan before 9/11 and we would have had to deal with sooner or later or b) Uzbeks, Chechens, Arabs and other foreigners that Pakistan offered sanctuaries to right after 9/11, but they later turned against Pakistan. The first suicide bombing in Pakistan was carried out by Al-Qaeda in Islamabad in 1995. Thousands of Shias were being massacred by armed sectarian groups prior to 9/11. These groups continue to operate with new names and new alliances, and continue to target Shias and Barelvis and other minorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no reason to believe Pakistan would have magically contained these groups. In fact, if 9/11 had not happened, the tipping point would have come in some other way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4) Pakistan&#8217;s economy suffered because of the war on terror: The question is, has the Pakistani economy suffered since 9/11 or grown? When we assign a monetary value to &#8216;missed&#8217; economic opportunities, we assume that if there had been no war on terror, Pakistan would grow at an ideal pace and opportunities would continue to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pakistan&#8217;s economy was in a poor state for years before 9/11 and without US help there is no reason to believe it would have improved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1999, Pakistan&#8217;s GDP was $75 billion. Ten years later, in 2009, it was $185 billion. In the same ten year period, Pakistan&#8217;s foreign reserves grew from $1.96 billion to $14 billion, exports from $7.5 billion to $18.45 billion, foreign direct investment from $1 billion to $4.6 billion, and development programs from Rs80 billion to Rs621 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5) That Pakistan can sustain a war against the US: Pakistan does not have enough troops to guard its border with India and fight a war on its border with Afghanistan. Most of Pakistan&#8217;s weapons come from the US and its allies. Pakistan&#8217;s economy cannot sustain a war. It has no power and no oil. With a dysfunctional railways, it has poor communications system. Recent incidents have also cast doubt on the capabilities of its intelligence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The US has failed to meet its goals in Afghanistan and is ready to leave, and that is why it is frustrated. But the Pakistan army must not continue to manipulate public opinion and propagate war rhetoric to a point where it limits its own options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible for Pakistan to invite the US in and then fight a long-term guerilla war, but are we ready to become another Afghanistan in a battle for control over Afghanistan?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In an innovative move last week, Pakistan’s top political leaders held a special prayer on the request of President Asif Zardari against natural disasters that have hit Pakistan. A government spokesman has denied reports that key members of the president’s cabinet ended up in hospitals after the prayers &#8211; an apparent sign that the prayers had been heard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Torrential rains and massive flooding in the province of Sindh and the Dengue epidemic in Punjab have worsened since, and critics believe it is because Interior Minister Rehman Malik did not read his verses right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clerics asked the people of the country to seek forgiveness for their (the clerics’) sins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This scribe has compiled the latest reports about the various natural disasters that have hit Pakistan:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) The dengue fever:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif has admonished the mosquito community on spreading the dengue fever and threatened them with immediate suspension for showing disobedience. He has put together a task force that will monitor the activities of mosquitoes and furnish a report in two weeks. Several mosquitoes that bit the chief minister were admitted to hospital with fever, nausea and extreme weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The opposition leader in Punjab criticised the chief minister for his poor handing of the issue. Experts say he has taken political point-scoring on the issue of mosquitoes to a level where his own face has started to resemble a fly flapper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In response, the PML(N) has threatened to organise a “long march” of dengue spreading mosquitoes towards Islamabad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Members of his the opposition called for a military operation against mosquitoes. But rising star Imran Khan has insisted on negotiations with the winged insects and a peaceful settlement of all outstanding issues. Defence experts believe the interests of the mosquitoes must be made part of any settlements for lasting peace to prevail. The opposition believes Law Minister Rana Sanaullah is secretly backing the mosquitoes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Biologists believe politicians will eventually win the war against mosquitoes. “Mosquitoes cannot compete with politicians,” a scientist said. “They have basic decency. Unlike Pakistan’s key politicians, they suck your blood only once and leave.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) Rains and floods:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chief justice has taken suo motu notice of the weather in Sindh. “If the rains do not stop immediately, they will be charged with contempt of court,” the top judge said. A government representative assured the court the flood victims would not be left alone. “They will not be alone. Other flood victims will join them soon.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thousands of journalists arrived in the province to report about the floods, but most of them were disappointed after their hopes of an encounter with Spongebob Squarepants were not fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a positive gesture, people from India sent their first tranche of aid to Pakistan’s flood victims. It includes several thousand towels. “That’s all they could think of sending off the top of their heads,” an expert explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the sentiment in Punjab is to reject foreign aid. “It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep,” a PML(N) leader said. Experts believe the PML(N) will continue to live like lions in Punjab (Lions get things done by brute force, their populations are limited to small habitats, and they don’t have the slightest clue about disaster management), but the same could not be said about the flood victims of Sindh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) Altaf Hussain’s speech:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major natural calamity hit every single one of Pakistan’s news channels last week. Initially believed to be a new episode of Britain’s Got Talent, the programme turned out to be a media conference by MQM’s top leader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Towards the end of the third hour, a number of analysts said they had been reminded of the movie Inception. “It was hard to keep track of reality, and we were not sure if the protagonist was conscious all this while.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite warnings before and immediately following the start of the calamity, people refused to evacuate. “I am not sure what I am doing here,” said one member of the audience. “That is something I have in common with Altaf Hussain.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier, Zulfiqar Mirza accused the MQM of violence and killings in Karachi. Asked if he had proof, Mirza said the MQM had hidden all the dead bodies in Altaf Hussain’s speeches. “That is why nobody gets to hear about them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to reports, the union of workers at the Taj Company went on a strike and threatened to quit their jobs after Zulfiqar Mirza and Altaf Hussain’s press conferences. “We have nothing to do with the violence and Karachi,” their leader said, “but they still kept making us pick up the Holy Quran all the time.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">“What do you want? War or peace?” The choice is not simple when the question appears on gunny sacks that carry mutilated dead bodies. Dead bodies that have been beheaded, or their eyes gouged out, or their noses and ears cut off, or their limbs and genitals severed (and if they are lucky, it is done in that order).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of these bodies are so brutally mutilated it is impossible to tell which of Karachi’s warring ethnic communities they belong to – the indigenous Sindhis who were originally rural, or the educated Mohajirs who came from India to fill in the gap in the city’s economy left by the emigration of the Hindus, or the Pashtuns from the northwest who took petty jobs in construction, textile and transport to make the prosperous 1960s possible, or the Baloch of Lyari who have fished in the port city for centuries. It is ironic, because these bodies are not just waste products of turf wars between ghettoised rival ethnic communities. They are among the various sites on which these wars are fought.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Corpses as postcards:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To mutilate a body is to cut – to deprive the whole of its part – or to disfigure – to make the perfect imperfect. That is different from a birth defect that has always been there (so Rehman Malik’s alleged congenital lying problem may be eventually be excused), or from a medical condition for which quarantine is necessary (so people from rival ethnic communities are safe as long as they stay enclosed in spaces assigned to them) – because in mutilation, the defect is brought about by an external force. And that is what makes the mutilation of dead bodies symbolically charged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It signals control. One ethnic group has control over the body of a member of the other. In that way, mutilation is like writing. “Look, dear enemy, we are in control.” (This is different from rape because it does not specifically choose genital areas as the site of inscription.) A handwriting analysis of this inscription shows these mutilations carry the surplus angst of warring ethnic groups in a metropolitan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Politics and economics of mutilation:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) The rivals are seen as infiltrators, who blend in and cannot be told apart. Inscription serves to mark their bodies, so that they can be cognised and recognised. That signals a kind of administrative authority similar to that being exercised in a government census – they are declared minority, managed, and assigned spaces that they must not violate. That can also be compared to the branding of cattle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) This signalling is meant to be seen. It is a) public, and b) visual (it was often filmed with mobile phone cameras and spread around, including via the internet). And that is because it is meant to bring shame. It publicises disfigurement and imperfection – things that are not meant to be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) The mutilated bodies are packed into gunny sacks that are meant for commodities. And that points out the economics of it all. The dead bodies have an exchange value. Some of these killings are meant as revenge of previous killings (the number of corpses sent out must always be more than the number of corpses received). Others are done in exchange for the city’s resources that the rival community is seen as stealing from. Like Shylock’s loan in Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, these resources are, in the words of Karl Marx “transformed through consumption of the means of subsistence into flesh and blood”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem with peace:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When people die at the hands of members of a rival ethnic group, it hurts the whole community. The community is itself mutilated (An external power has deprived the whole of its part). The dead individual cannot be shamed. His community is shamed because a) the body of one of its members is in control of the rival group (hence the need for more influence), and b) it does not have the power to save or rescue him (hence the need for more turf). A new power dynamic is established and it is not acceptable to the victim’s community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then the question is, “What do you want? War, or peace?” The problem with peace is, it comes with certain conditions that have oppression inherent in them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Thousands of young men celebrated Pakistan’s Defence Day on Tuesday, in ways that proved they are not fit for military service. Politicians paid tributes to the military men of honour, without specifying if they included Gen Pervez Musharraf. Military leaders vowed to change history, but there were reports they had mobilised people to make changes to Wikipedia instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In true military spirit, schoolchildren were forced to attend events that inculcated bravery in them, but it was ensured that their holiday is not ruined with history lessons. Security had been heightened on this occasion and police laid special emphasis on beating up motorcyclists. Civilians were not allowed at the celebrations. There were reports that a fire drill was carried on the occasion, but the rumour was later blamed on rows after rows of empty chairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that so many chairs were empty, and that the state-run Pakistan Television has less audience than the number of republican presidential candidates in the US, proves that it is imperative for us to re-evaluate our history and come up with new, out-of-the-box solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The military and its wars: “The Pakistani military loves peace, but its love for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,” a defence expert said while talking about Pakistan’s military history. At other times, however, the military’s weakness has also been misconstrued as love for peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Indian military, known for having the wisdom of youth and the energy of old age, has thrust four key wars on Pakistan since Independence. The Pakistani military did not fight the first, could not win the second, lost the third and denied fighting the fourth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the more recent war on terror against non-state actors, the Pakistani military has often followed the great Gandhian principles of non-violence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Critics believe the military has been involved in political issues for many years and has lost its ability to fight. “History has proven that political leaders are better at mobilising people for war,” an analyst said, making a veiled reference to violence in Karachi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Wise men say a people who cannot fight each other cannot fight the enemy,” a political analyst elaborated. Wise men denied the allegation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite a series of embarrassments including a US raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad and an attack on Mehran naval base in Karachi in which key aircrafts were destroyed, the defence analysts believe the military has the ability to respond swiftly to threats. “Even on the occasions you mentioned,” a defence expert said, “we reacted immediately and called 15.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Politicians and their economy: Many politicians from across the spectrum also criticise the military for taking away more than half of the country’s money each year and believe the money should be spent on development and welfare. “They steal all our taxes and spend them on housing projects,” a politician told this scribe at his residence in Defence. Asked how much taxes he had paid, the leader subjected this scribe to the same treatment that Dr Amir Liaquat gave to an honourable cleric in his TV programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Critics of democracy believe the Pakistani political leadership has been involved in fighting for many years and has lost its ability to run the economy. “History has proven that Pakistani military has always been better at running the economy,” a defence expert said, adding that economic growth since the civilians took over has been slower than cricketer Kamran Akmal’s reflexes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Politicians however believe welfare is more important than growth. According to a new and remarkable proposal, the government will shut down all its departments, saving billions of rupees in operational costs. “Government employees will now be given their salaries on their doorsteps,” an economist said. New staff will be hired for the purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People and their concerns: Common people have rejected arguments from both sides. Many of them have decided not to depend on the government and the military for prosperity and security. “We do not need the army,” said a citizen from Pakistan’s cultural hub Lahore. “There is a Pir in our locality who can protect us with black magic.” A man from Pakistan’s economic centre, Karachi, said it was possible to earn thousands of dollars on the internet without doing anything, according to information he received in an email from a Nigerian citizen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The solution: Pakistan is at a critical juncture right now, and it is time for the top brains among us to sit down and devise a solution. This scribe, being one of them, believes after carrying out the above research that the solution to Pakistan’s problems is that politicians should be in charge of fighting, and the military should run the economy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer: Intended for the purposes of satire.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Pakistan&#8217;s problems will not be solved in parliament, but in the streets,&#8221; Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif said on Monday. He did not clarify if those streets included the one from which Shahbaz Taseer was abducted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement is significant because it was made by the chief minister of the country’s largest and laziest province. Shahbaz Sharif is also an aspiring chief of one of the province’s largest party, Pakistan Muslim League(Nawaz) – PML(N). He is stopped only by his elder brother’s refusal to retire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PML(N) is known for its bold stance on a number of issues and is represented by the lion &#8211; an animal that is brave, loud, runs fasts but in very short bursts, has poor organisation skills and little economic know-how, gets things done by brute force, and its population is limited to very small habitats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The chief minister returned from his recent trip to Karachi where he proposed solutions to the city’s law and order problems. He said he had made the recommendations after consulting intellectuals, but the intellectuals have denied the allegation. It was initially reported that Shahbaz showed video clips of security failures during his lecture, but participants later confirmed that it was the news of Shahbaz Taseer’s abduction running on TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the latest in the series of high profile abductions. “Everybody has the right to peaceful abductions,” Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah said. “There are no Punjabi Taliban,” he said to a question. “We are all Pakistani Taliban.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shahbaz Sharif has traditionally been open to negotiations with terrorists, but is not willing to extend the same offer to the Punjab Assembly. Sources have alleged that the PML(N) is working on Restoration of Mughal Archaeological Sites and Political System Act. They cited Rana Sanaullah’s moustache as evidence. The party denied the allegation but one party insider opined it would be administratively more effective if the chief minister could at least wear a crown to indicate who is in charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shahbaz said a final decision on how to bring a revolution would be made after Nawaz Sharif returns from his trip abroad. Nawaz Sharif has been the prime minister twice and spent several years in recluse in Saudi Arabia, having been counted out in Pakistan’s politics. But he later returned young and energetic, giving rise to speculations that he was suffering from the Benjamin Button disease. “I remember having seen someone like him when I was young,” an elderly man said when asked about Nawaz Sharif. “But he had less hair. Perhaps he was some uncle of Nawaz.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Like a smart ex-prime minister, he pretends he has never been the prime minister,” a political analyst said. Insiders believe it is very hard for Shahbaz Sharif to become the chief of the party, especially because it is named after his elder brother. Sources in the party said if Shahbaz takes over, the name of the party will remain PML(N) -Pakistan Muslim League(Not).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A large number of Muslims in Pakistan are fasting in the holy month of Ramzan with religious zeal and fervour. The other 160 million risk going to jail. Some of them fast several times a day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The people of the Islamic republic exhibit exemplary patience in this month, this scribe has learned, except the few who are invited to free Iftaris.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Religious and political leaders have stressed the need for 30 days of restraint and peace, after which the nation will celebrate 326 days of gluttony and greed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“By being hungry, we get to know how other people feel when they are hungry,” a cleric said while packing his Samosas in a copy of Ehtram-e-Ramzan Ordinance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following in the footsteps of top journalist Sohail Warraich, this scribe attended free Iftaris hosted by various leaders and asked them what message they would give to the people of Pakistan in the holy month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fareed Paratha:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Jamaat-e-Islami leader believes Islam is a complete way of life which came with a diet plan that would stop him from becoming even more fat. Analysts believe the renowned scholar would get into shape, but some fear that shape will be round.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reaction from supporters: “We will put the &#8216;slim&#8217; back in &#8216;Muslim&#8217;,” members of his party told this scribe. They said they had made groups of young men who would go out in the city and wake people up twice every day for the Sehr and Iftar meals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lahsan Iqbal:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The veteran politician from PML(N) said Ramzan is a month in which we should reflect on the sins, excesses and mistakes, that have been made by the ruling PPP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He also divulged the effect of fasting on foreign policy. “This will indicate to the US that Pakistanis can happily starve and don&#8217;t need foreign help.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reaction from supporters: Members of his party believe Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif had shelved USAID programmes for provision of clean drinking water in Punjab&#8217;s villages in preparation for Ramzan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pervaiz Malai:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PML(Q) top leader who was once a contender for prime minister announced his support for Indian activist Anna Hazare who is fasting to bring attention to the problem of corruption in India. Calling for interfaith harmony and better ties with India, he said, “All religions of the world teach their followers to strive, with the goal of being in power one day.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reaction from supporters: This scribe tried to contact Pervaiz Malai&#8217;s supporters but all five of them were not available for comment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Khajoor Wassan:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sindh home minister urged the need for peace and urged various groups in Karachi to stop fighting. “The only thing we should fight in these days is logic,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reaction from supporters: This scribe interviewed activists backed by the PPP but could not hear them properly because of their loud gunfire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imran Khan:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rebel PTI leader has mysteriously disappeared since the beginning of Ramzan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Postscript: Talking to this scribe, renowned cleric Aamir Hamaqat warned against using filthy language in the holy month. “Those who say bad words and those who hear them both commit a sin,” he said. Upon hearing that, this scribe stopped interviewing him and left without reminding him that the name of that actor is Prem Nath.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Thousands of young men violated traffic laws and norms of decency to celebrate Pakistan’s 64th Independence Day this week. Anti-American sentiments ran high after Lady Gaga stole all the attention away once again. Many of those who were celebrating took off their shirts to show solidarity with poor people and actress Veena Malik.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of deaths and injuries were reported in traffic accidents. “This is what we have learned from our great history,” a security analyst said. “We are brave Muslims and we always look for adventures. It does not matter if we risk the lives of those who are sitting on the back seat and not making the decisions.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are ready to sacrifice our lives for our country,” a woman said while falling down from a motorcycle. She was later seen asking around for the phone number of the 1-1-7 ambulance service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Do you know what this flag is telling us?” another defence expert asked while pointing to a waving flag. “It is telling us nothing. It is just waving.” He waved back at the flag. “The ideal Pakistani should not think about what he is doing,” the expert said in what appeared to be a veiled reference to cricketer Shahid Afridi. He could not be reached for an explanation because his motorcycle was too loud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The spectacular show of patriotism on the Pakistani streets has also put an end to speculation that there is a fuel or electricity shortage in the country, improving Pakistan’s image and selling the right signal to the US that Pakistan can take care of itself and Afghanistan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, a number of unfortunate incidents were also reported on the occasion. This scribe lost his identity card after his pocket was picked. A number of journalists also lost their identity in the ruckus. Back-up copies of all important personal information and phone contacts were later obtained from the spooks. Several women complained of being mistreated, including being searched by unauthorised personnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were no additional measures to control crime or traffic, after the decision last month to restrict the movement of American diplomats. Movement of terrorists could not be restricted, however. More than 14 people were killed in two terrorist attacks in Balochistan and the Tribal Areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reports saddened the revellers. “Why do these people attack their own country for a few bucks from America?” one asked. “For me, my country is like gold. I will only sell it when the price is right.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">American attempts to sabotage the celebrations had begun weeks ago in the lead-up to the celebrations. Several newspapers had reported the victimisation of Pakistan’s top female defence expert by an American citizen in a restaurant. It is being reported that the Raymond Davis-like American had deliberately hit her chair when he was moving back his own. The people of Pakistan are now demanding a restriction on the movement on Americans’ chairs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Thousands of girlfriends and wives were arrested by paramilitary troops in a string operation this week to deweaponise the violence-hit city of Karachi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several hundred people have died in the recent unrest in the port city, and a law-enforcement operation was expected after Interior Minister Rehman Malik said girlfriends and wives were responsible for 70 percent of the killings. It is pertinent to mention here that love is a crime under the Pakistani common law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stocks plunged as share prices of mobile phone companies declined steeply after the government announced it would cleanse the city of girlfriends and wives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Television business was also hurt by falling ratings of talk shows featuring Imran Khan. Several cooking shows were shut down. Approximately, one million women in Karachi are regular viewers of cooking shows, according to a recent report. About 73.4 percent of them host their own cooking show. Among them is an elderly mastermind made popular by SMS jokes. She is now on the government’s most wanted list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Civil rights groups are furious. “It is unacceptable and irrational,” a women’s leader said in a press conference, “to have feelings of affection towards the male gender. These women deserve no mercy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Police reported no reaction from husbands over the weekend. But hundreds of men from all walks of life took to the streets early Monday to protest the arrests. They were holding placards and banners asking for breakfast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jail officials said the arrested women mostly slept or gossiped in their free time. Riots were reported after the new inmates declined to eat food that they said was not cooked according to their liking. Three inmates fought after one was irritated by others repeatedly asking how long she was going to take in the toilet. Backed with supporters among the inmates and some jail officials, they are now fighting over control of the toilets, kitchens and common areas. Jail officials said most of them refuse to clean their cells and a majority forces other inmates to clean for them. Accusations of stealing are rampant. Many women come out of their cells only when they have to eat. “We are very happy with these developments,” a jail official said on condition of anonymity. “It is a clear sign that these women are being rehabilitated and will come out of the prison ready to act like men.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Religious groups hailed the move and went on to ask the government to end all soap operas, music shows and other obscene programmes on TV. “There should be more programmes on TV that feature our renowned and popular religious leaders,” they said in a statement sent to the press earlier this week. The government thanked the clerics for the support and announced it had accepted their demand. In a notification, TV channels were asked to give more air time to crime and terrorism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imran Khan agreed to support the operation after he was assured during a meeting with representatives of the establishment that his key supporters would not be categorised as women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Representatives of his party met with other political leaders yesterday to announce support for the operation. “We will fight terror with terror,” a spokesman said. “We can negotiate with terrorists,” he said while elaborating Pakistan’s policy on dealing with violence, “but we will not negotiate with our wives and girlfriends.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hina Rabbani Khar is not Pakistan’s new foreign minister, a source close to the policymakers said in a remarkable revelation this week. “It is not Khar but her Hermes Birkin bag that was appointed to office last month,” he told this scribe. “The idea was to promote the soft image of Pakistan.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He cited the coverage of the bag in the Indian and Pakistani media and the analyses its role received in impacting ties between the two countries as evidence of his claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The appointment is likely to have serious economic impact and indicates Pakistan’s changing foreign policy especially towards America and its war on terror. “The price of the bag is close to the annual US aid to Pakistan,” a foreign policy expert said, “and the move signals to the US that Pakistan might not need financial help any longer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We needed someone to carry it around,” the official said, “and there was no other politician we could appoint to take care of Pakistan’s precious economic resource.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Critics denied the report as a rumour spread by the establishment in the form of a leak. “The establishment has become fond of making political jokes,” an expert said. It is pertinent to mention here that most of these political jokes later became federal ministers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Analysts do agree that the Birkin bag fits the profile of a traditional male foreign minister quite well &#8212; It belongs to a family that has been influential for centuries, it is oversized, has a big mouth but doesn’t know how to speak, it takes months to get hold of it, and it does not have the ability to make foreign policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on these qualities, some foreign policy experts do not see the new appointment as a radical change. “It’s not like Shah Mahmood Qureshi came with a shoulder strap.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The report sparked a debate on Twitter about the gender of the bag and its implications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the new revelation, results in public polls in the print media led Urdu columnists to demand an apology from Hina Rabbani Khar for being rich. They said she was cut off from the public and therefore did not qualify to be the foreign minister. One suggested she drive a rickshaw for several years first, to connect with the common people and learn the art of negotiation with stubborn opponents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Religious parties had similarly demanded an apology from Hina for being a woman. At the time of the filing of this report, she had not officially denied the allegation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her supporters in English newspapers and the blogosphere however denied that she was pretty, dismissing reports of her good looks as baseless propaganda. Some have urged the minister to grow a moustache to dispel the impression among common people that she is pretty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, feminists have strongly protested calling Hina Rabbani Khar a woman, saying the W word is derogatory. “It is a different thing if we call each other women,” one civil society representative told this scribe while twisting her moustache. “For us, it is diminutive but inclusive.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the revelation that it was the Birkin bag and not Hina whose qualifications needed to be analysed, a number of political analysts expressed satisfaction with the government’s new move. “Pakistan has come a long long way in the last few months,” an expert said. “Having a designer bag as a federal minister is significantly better than having no foreign minister at all.”</p>
