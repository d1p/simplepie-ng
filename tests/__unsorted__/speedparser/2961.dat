		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/for-online-advertising-big-impression-counts-dont-mean-high-audience-reach/"><![CDATA[<p>New research from Nielsen suggests that, while some individual websites perform very well at reaching an ad campaign’s intended audience, nearly all campaigns are delivered to consumers who are not valued by the brand advertiser. In a <a href="http://nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports-downloads/2011/reaching-the-right-audiences-online-campaign-ratings.html" target="_blank">recent study</a>, Nielsen measured a campaign for a beauty care brand that was hoping to improve its image among younger women. The advertiser designed a campaign focused on women 18-34 and ran 213 million impressions across 14 websites and ad networks for a six week period. Nielsen analysis showed that 33 percent of the impressions reached the desired audience (W 18-34), while 40 percent of the impressions were served to men.</p>
<p>Looking across dozens of campaigns spanning hundreds of websites, the results were the same, showing that the web consistently delivers millions of impressions – if not tens of millions – to the wrong people.</p>
<p>In the same beauty care product campaign, the 213 million impressions tracked-to-date seems to be at a level that could generate significant reach. In reality, the campaign overall hit slightly more than 40 million people across all demographic segments —a 13.6 percent reach. After focusing in on women 18-34, the campaign reached only 10.5 million women.</p>

<p>Despite these numbers, Nielsen research shows that the web does in fact deliver audiences more efficiently than some popular TV programs with very broad audiences.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/research-shows-link-between-online-brand-metrics-and-offline-sales/"><![CDATA[<p>Advertisers looking to build their brands online will need to look beyond traditional web metrics to determine if their investments are paying off, according to a recent study by Nielsen. In a new report, <a href="http://nielsen.com//content/corporate/us/en/insights/reports-downloads/2011/online-advertising-brand-building.html" target="_blank">Beyond Clicks and Impressions: Examining the Relationship Between Online Advertising and Brand Building</a>, there is emerging evidence that brand metrics – which show attitudinal response to online campaigns – can predict offline sales. The research further shows that there’s virtually no relationship between click-through rates and brand opinion or offline sales.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29331" title="brand-effect-1" src="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-1.png" alt="brand-effect-1" width="575" height="397" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29334" title="brand-effect-2" src="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-2.png" alt="brand-effect-2" width="575" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>In the study, Nielsen examined how exposure to Internet ad campaigns influenced brand measures such as ad recall and likeability, and whether the consumer said they were more likely to purchase the product after viewing the ad. The analysis showed that online ads do, on average, succeed in influencing brand engagement and opinion, particularly for ad recall and message association. However, the degree of positive brand impact largely depends on the strength of the ad itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29335" title="brand-effect-3" src="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-3.png" alt="brand-effect-3" width="575" height="348" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29337" title="brand-effect-4" src="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/brand-effect-4.png" alt="brand-effect-4" width="575" height="395" /></a></p>
<p>The study then connected brand engagement results with actual offline sales measured by Nielsen. While based on a small number of cases to-date, the research showed that campaigns in which consumers reported an increase in purchase intent after viewing an online ad also showed a boost in offline product sales. Cases with flat purchase intent showed no significant change in sales.</p>
<p>Additionally, the research showed that the click-through rate for a given ad campaign showed no connection to sales lift and no measure of whether the message resonated with consumers.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/global-ad-spend-rises-5-7-for-q2-2011/"><![CDATA[<p>Despite overall growth of 5.7 percent for the advertising industry in Q2 2011, ad spending fell in nearly half the world’s key markets in the second quarter of this year as economic concerns continued to impact the advertising industry, according to Nielsen’s quarterly <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/press-room/2011/global-ad-spend-up-in-q2-2011.html" target="_blank">Global AdView Pulse </a>report.</p>
<p>“Compared to the 8.9 percent growth rate in the first quarter of the year, there was definitely some slowdown,” observed Randall Beard, Global Head of Advertiser Solutions for Nielsen. “But, based on the global economy and the financial problems many countries have experienced, a 5.7 percent increase for quarterly year-on-year global ad spend is still great news.”</p>
<p>Global advertising in Q2 totaled USD127 billion (mainly based on published rate cards and four major media types), and the first half of 2011 closed with a +7.2 percent growth over the same period in 2010.</p>
<p>Highlights from Nielsen’s <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/press-room/2011/global-ad-spend-up-in-q2-2011.html">Global AdView Pulse</a> report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising revenue dropped in 16 out of 36 global markets covered by the Nielsen Global AdView Pulse</li>
<li>Argentina reported the highest year-on-year quarterly increase of 28.5 percent.  Egypt was the hardest hit (-51.7% YOY)</li>
<li>Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) advertising posted its lowest quarterly growth since the Q1 2009 Pulse report: 4 percent globally including declines of -3.6 percent in Europe and -3.0 percent in North America.</li>
<li>Clothing and accessories, which was among the worst hit recession categories in 2009, posted the highest quarterly year-on-year increase in Q2 – up 17.9 percent globally, driven by a 27.9 percent increase in Asia Pacific.</li>
<li>While radio posted the largest percentage increase among all traditional media in Q2 (+8.2%), overall television continued to dominate global advertising, accounting for 65 percent of total spend.</li>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/global/mobile-phones-dominate-in-south-africa/"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Jan Hutton, Director, Telecoms, Nielsen Southern Africa</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Africa is in the midst of a technological revolution, and nothing illustrates that fact than the proliferation of mobile phones. Consider this: more Africans have access to mobile phones than to clean drinking water. In South Africa, the continent’s strongest economy, mobile phone use has gone from 17 percent of adults in 2000 to 76 percent in 2010. Today, more South Africans – 29 million – use mobile phones than radio (28 million), TV (27 million) or personal computers (6 million). Only 5 million South Africans use landline phones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/south-africa-tech.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-29295 alignnone" title="Technology Use in South Africa" src="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/south-africa-tech.png" alt="Technology Use in South Africa" width="550" height="427" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nielsen’s recently released Mobile Insights study in South Africa, which examined consumers’ usage of and attitudes toward mobile phones, networks and services, reveals a number of interesting insights:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>High levels of network loyalty:</strong> 95 percent of subscribers have been with their carrier for an average of 4.2 years, and 81 percent said they’d recommend their network providers to friends and family, reinforcing the importance of word-of-mouth and reputation in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Move from pre-paid to contracts: </strong>While pre-paid plans still make up between 82 and 85 percent of the market, 25 percent of subscribers say they could switch from pre-paid to contract packages within the next year.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Network quality a key decision factor:</strong> More than a quarter (27%) said they left their previous provider due to poor network quality.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Nokia rules:</strong> More than half (52%) own that company’s handsets, followed by Samsung and BlackBerry, and 56 percent of those currently using other brands indicated their next handset would likely be a Nokia.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How do South Africans Use their phones?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As in other countries, mobile phones are being used in a range of ways aside from talking. South Africa ranks fifth in the world for mobile data usage, ahead of the United States, which ranks seventh.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More than 20 percent of those surveyed said they download ringtones and a similar number said they download music. Wallpapers, screensavers and pictures are also popular downloadables. The mobile phone as an Internet device is also on the rise – 11 percent of South Africans use their mobiles to go online, and consumers aged 25-34 are the heaviest users. Facebook is the most popular social media platform, used by 85 percent of mobile subscribers. Half of all users of Facebook in South Africa access the site via their mobiles. MXIT, a mobile instant messaging platform, is also popular in the country, with 61 percent saying they access the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SMS text messaging is practically ubiquitous among South African mobile customers, and is used by almost 4.2 times more people than e-mail. More than two-thirds (69%) of consumers prefer sending texts to calling, in large part because it is less expensive, and 10 percent believe texting to be a faster way of communicating.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The majority (60%) of South African mobile users said they are aware of mobile banking services offered by banks, but only 21 percent say they use such services. A much larger number of those aware of the services said they would never use them, suggesting banks might need to invest in communicating the benefits and security of mobile banking.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This survey provides a comprehensive benchmark against which the changes occurring in the rapidly evolving telecom sector can be measured. When one considers that just three years ago, there were no smartphones being used on the continent, the pace of change is stunning. South Africa is the biggest market, but other countries on the continent are likely to catch up fast.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/nearly-75-of-consumers-remember-an-ad-when-viewed-across-media-platforms/"><![CDATA[<p>New research from Nielsen, commissioned by Google, shows that advertising on multiple platforms substantially increases consumers’ ability to remember an ad campaign compared to when the ad is viewed on TV alone.</p>
<p>In a media lab study conducted by Nielsen, participants viewed related content across a TV, computer, smartphone and tablet. A 15-second video ad promoting a premium sports sedan was shown to different groups with some people seeing no ads, and others seeing the ad on different combinations of screens.</p>
<p>In the group that was exposed to TV ads alone, 50 percent of people correctly attributed the ad to the correct auto brand. For groups that saw the ad across all screens – TV, computer, smartphone and tablet – the ability to remember the brand jumped dramatically to nearly three-in-four (74%).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Google_awareness_Ad.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29254" title="google ad awareness" src="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Google_awareness_Ad.gif" alt="google ad awareness" width="394" height="394" /></a></p>
<p>Similarly, only 22 percent of the group exposed to just the TV ad was able to correctly remember that the ad was for a 4-door sedan versus 39 percent of the group that saw the ad across all screens.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Google_engagement_Ad.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29255" title="Google_engagement_Ad" src="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Google_engagement_Ad.gif" alt="Google_engagement_Ad" width="394" height="394" /></a></p>
<p>While research shows that TV remains the strongest driver of awareness, the study demonstrates that the addition of online and mobile campaigns returns the highest overall brand impact.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/top-20-games-to-watch-gamers-make-their-holiday-wish-lists/"><![CDATA[<p>Which video game titles top gamers&#8217; wish lists this year? Nielsen’s Top 20 Games to Watch reveals the most anticipated games of the 2011 holiday season, with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 the most coveted among active U.S. gamers. The list was developed by examining a variety of consumer measures from Nielsen’s Video Game Tracking survey, including the top five titles active gamers are considering for purchase.</p>
<p>To help narrow the focus of this analysis, Nielsen filtered the field to those titles releasing on at least one of the three major consoles (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii) during the timeframe of late August to late November. This year’s list underscores the various interests of gamers—as well as the strength of video game brands. All but one of the Top 20 titles stem from a franchise, with brands such as Madden NFL and The Legend of Zelda dating back more than 20 years. Deep Silver’s Dead Island represents the lone new IP included on this year’s list.</p>
<p>Activision’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, an expected juggernaut for this holiday season, is desired by more than one quarter (27%) of active gamers. Microsoft’s Gears of War 3 and EA’s Madden NFL 12 follow closely behind; both titles were selected by nearly one out of every five (19%) active gamers. Apart from Gears of War 3 for Xbox 360, other platform exclusives expected to resonate strongly with consumers in the coming months include Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword for Wii and Sony’s Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception for PS3.</p>
<p>Nielsen’s Top 20 Games to Watch is supplemented by information from <a href="http://www.nmincite.com">NM Incite</a>, a Nielsen McKinsey company, which analyzed the primary elements driving consumers’ online conversations around each title. Recent consumer buzz shows that those anticipating Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: Revelations are excited for the return of multi-player functionality to the franchise, while gamers looking forward to Warner Bros Interactive’s Batman: Arkham City are speculating on the villains they’ll face in the new title. Fans of EA’s FIFA franchise are hoping for more pro and career mode options in the upcoming iteration, and those addicted to Microsoft’s Dance Central are rejoicing in the news that they’ll be able to import tracks from the original title into the sequel.</p>

While Action/Adventure games hold the most spots in the Top 20, the list is a testament to the diverse interests of today’s gamers—from the intense action of First Person Shooters like Square Enix’s Deus Ex: Human Revolution, to the energetic enthusiasm of Music / Rhythm games such as Ubisoft’s Just Dance 3, to the epic sense of adventure in Bethesda’s RPG Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Sports and racing titles like 2K’s NBA 2K12 and EA’s Need For Speed: The Run are represented as well.</p>
<div style="table_meta">* Data collected between the timeframe of August 21 – September 17, during which ~ 5,000 active gamers were interviewed for Video Game Tracking via online survey, and 417,433,251 online conversations were examined by NM Incite.</p>
<p>** Top 5 is the proportion of respondents that rank each title in their top five titles being considered for purchase.  Percents shown are among those active gamers that qualify for at least one platform on which the title is being released.</p></div>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/friends-following-and-feedback-how-were-using-social-media/"><![CDATA[<p>Nielsen’s recent <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/social/">Social Media Report</a> revealed the size of the audience and the degree of consumption across social networking platforms in the U.S., and now new research by NM Incite, a Nielsen/McKinsey Company, further explores the reasons U.S. social media users visit these sites.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the top drivers of social media use among social networkers are keeping in touch with family and friends (89% and 88%, respectively) and finding new friends (70%).  Another driver of use is the desire to view and contribute to reviews of products and services as 68 percent of social media users go to social networking sites to read product reviews and over half use these sites to provide product feedback, both positive and negative.  Other top reasons social media users engage in social networking include entertainment (67%), as a creative outlet (64%), to learn about products (58%), and to get coupons or promotions (54%).</p>
<p>The study also looked at the differences in use among social media users with children and those without, finding that parents are more likely than non-parents to use social media for almost every thing, with dating being the exception.  Parents are 26 percent more likely than non-parents to visit social networks to play games, 23 percent more likely to use as a creative outlet and 20 percent more likely to use for entertainment.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p>NM Incite’s ‘State of Social Media Survey’ is based on a representative sample of 1,865 adult (18+) social media users who were recruited from the Nielsen Online Panel to take an online survey. “Social media user” is defined as participating, talking, and networking online through various platforms to share information and resources. This includes Internet forums, blogs, Facebook, Twitter, video sharing, consumer rating and other social networking websites. The survey fielded from March 31 to April 14, 2011.</p>

Hispanic or Latino TV households will increase 4.6 percent (over 600,000). The TV Universe Estimate for the 2011-2012 season marks the first integration of the 2010 Census counts and adjusted TV penetrations, introducing a number of shifts nationally and within local markets.</p>

<p>“The rapid growth of the Hispanic market has generated a number of headlines since the Census numbers were revealed, but the increase of Asian households should not be overlooked,” said Pat McDonough, Senior Vice President, Insights and Analysis, Nielsen. “The rate of change in Asian TV households outpaces that of Hispanic homes.”</p>
<p>Los Angeles remains the top market for both Hispanic and Asian TV households, while New York holds onto the top spot for African-American TV homes.</p>
<p>“We’re also seeing increased geographic diversity of Hispanic and Latino consumers. While Los Angeles, Miami-Ft. Lauderdale and Houston remain in the top five for Hispanic TV homes, we’re seeing growth in markets that defy conventional wisdom. Hartford &amp; New Haven, Conn., Washington, D.C., Milwaukee, Raleigh and Minneapolis are all in the top 50 and saw a bump up in their rankings in the past year,&#8221; McDonough added.</p>
<p>These estimates are projected to January 1, 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Calculating Universal Estimates</strong><br />
Nielsen’s total household and population estimates are based on the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as auxiliary sources such as state governments and the U.S. postal service. The 2012 UEs were benchmarked to the 2010 Census results released earlier this year and growth to 2012 has been projected based on estimated growth rates.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/in-u-s-market-new-smartphone-buyers-increasingly-embracing-android/"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Don Kellogg, Director of Telecom Research &amp; Insights</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to an August survey, 43 percent of all smartphone owners have an Android device. But if you ask only those who got a new smartphone in the past three months what kind of phone they chose, more than half (56%) will tell you they picked an Android device.  The preferences of these so-called “recent acquirers” are important as they are often a leading indicator of where the market is going.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Apple iOS remains popular in second place with 28 percent of all smartphone users, and the same percentage among those who recently got a new device.  But those figures could change quickly in the months to come.  Every time Apple launches a new iPhone or makes it available on a new wireless carrier, there is an increase in their sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Changes in share aside, the smartphone pie is getting bigger. While 43 percent of all mobile subscribers in the US had a smartphone as of August, 56 percent of those who got a new device in the last 3 months chose a smartphone over a feature phone. The holiday season and the launch of new devices like the next iPhone could further accelerate smartphone adoption, though this is always tempered by the fact that many consumers are unwilling or unable to break their service contracts before they expire.  In any event, the growing popularity of app-and-media friendly smartphones spells tremendous opportunity for those advertisers, publishers and developers eager to leverage mobile media.</p>
