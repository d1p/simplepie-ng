			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a <strong>big</strong> fan of financial expert Dave Ramsey.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no secret to anyone who has been reading this blog for more than a few weeks.  We conduct our business 100% debt free.  We never spend other people&#8217;s money, take outside investors or generally spend money before we&#8217;ve earned it. So when Dave released a new book, titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451617852/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thranggam-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1451617852" target="_blank">EntreLeadership</a>, I got pretty excited.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2188" title="Dave Ramsey" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dave_ramsey_laugh_radio_t960.jpg" alt="Dave Ramsey" width="560" height="373" /></p>
<p>Last night I was reading a <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" target="_blank">ZenHabits</a> blog titled <a href="http://zenhabits.net/start-slow/" target="_blank">Start Slow</a> and guest blogger <a href="http://daveursillo.com/" target="_blank">Dave Ursillo</a> posed that to appreciate a slower life, a more dedicated life, we should start our day not by rushing off to the office to tackle that ToDo list but instead to read a chapter or two of a good book &#8211; a book that inspires us.</p>
<p>What better book to be inspired by than Dave Ramsey&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451617852/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thranggam-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1451617852" target="_blank">EntreLeadership</a>?</p>
<p><span id="more-2176"></span></p>
<p>Dave&#8217;s story is not too far removed from my own: a young, married father who hit rock bottom, saw great success and then watched that success slip through his fingers. What Dave did after his crash has been one of many inspirational fables that I&#8217;ve adhered to in rebuilding my own life and redefining myself as the SEO you know today.</p>
<p>I read the first chapter of EntreLeadership, and be it less than macho or not, it brought tears to my eyes. One specific story (and this is in the Amazon preview of the book as well so hopefully they won&#8217;t sue me for retelling it) but the story involves a man who had also run into some hard times. He&#8217;d had to do the unthinkable and layoff about 250 workers from his factory.</p>
<p>That in itself makes my heart feel tight. Hiring is hard enough, but firing is the absolute worst part of being a business owner. I feel very responsible for every member of our team and to think of the pain this man must have endured to have to layoff, even temporarily, 250 families, 250 potential mothers and fathers, is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Dave went on to share how this man, passionate about his business and a servant leader to these workers who had placed their faith in him, started parking at the very back of his factory&#8217;s parking lot. This way, each day he walked past 250 empty parking spots, 250 reasons for why he had to turn things around, get those sales back up, put the factory back to work, and put those families back in those parking spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2191" title="Empty Parking Lot" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/empty-parking-lot.jpg" alt="Empty Parking Lot" width="550" height="326" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a sad story, but it&#8217;s a hopeful one. I sat there this morning, with my five-month-old Labrador pup Casey resting his head on my lap, reading what Dave and his team of EntreLeaders have learned over the past 20 years. That was the slow and dedicated start to my morning that I wanted, that I needed.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been following last week&#8217;s blog, <a href="http://www.imagefreedom.com/blog/white-hat-seo-might-get-you-beat-up" target="_blank">White Hat SEO Might Get You Beat Up</a>, you&#8217;ll know that we&#8217;ve been battling with a very competitive keyword against several companies who have been doing SEO for a lot longer than our client. A company fueled by paid links and other Black Hat tactics has been winning in this space and we&#8217;d been fighting to get our client onto the first page.</p>
<p>As soon as I closed EntreLeadership, using the front cover to mark my place at the start of Chapter 2, I flicked open my iPhone for the first time that morning and saw a familiar sight for a Tuesday morning. See, on Tuesdays <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/rank-tracker" target="_blank">SEOmoz&#8217;s Rank Tracker</a> tool checks the rankings of all our targeted keywords for nearly two dozen websites and spits back the results as to how many had risen and fallen that week.</p>
<p>There it was, as if fated somehow to follow my purposeful &#8220;slow morning,&#8221; the news that this client had moved up seven spaces breaking onto the first page and into the top five. SEO doesn&#8217;t typically work this way. SEO doesn&#8217;t typically respond to you shouting out to the universe &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if we got this client onto page one?!&#8221; and God himself then has a sit-down with Matt Cutts to make it happen.</p>
<p>Nope. That isn&#8217;t the world we live in.</p>
<p>SEO takes time, dedication, research and passion to build the right links, organic White Hat links, that nurture the reputation of a website in a way that earn you the rankings you desire. I didn&#8217;t expect to have validation so soon after my <a href="http://www.imagefreedom.com/blog/white-hat-seo-might-get-you-beat-up" target="_blank">run in with the dark side</a>, I didn&#8217;t expect to see such a leap four days after being threatened by one of these competitors over a silly Google ranking, but I did.</p>
<p>Sometimes that is the world we live in, and that inspired me even more.  Charles R. Swindoll said, &#8220;Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how <em>you react to it.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last 30 days we had two executed contracts for over $30,000 in consulting that disappeared overnight due to corporate restructuring. We also had new business come out of nowhere and want to sign with us all in the same day. We said good-bye to some team members who moved on to new challenges and we welcomed two new members to the Image Freedom SEO consulting team.</p>
<p>I could have seen failure, I could have focused on the loss, I could choose to see these things through failure-tinted lenses (Lord knows I&#8217;ve experienced my fair share of failures to know what failure looks like) but <strong>that&#8217;s not what Dave would do</strong>. I&#8217;m grateful for EntreLeadership and everything that Dave Ramsey teaches, because were it not for the passion that we live by every day, we wouldn&#8217;t have the opportunities that we have and I wouldn&#8217;t be leading the best team of SEOs I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of working with.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>There is no passion to be found playing small &#8211; in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, while doing research for one of our SEO clients, I came across one of their competitors who was buying links, lots of links, on various websites, blogs, and really surprising to me but local TV stations as well.  People &#8220;buy links&#8221; or purchase &#8220;paid links&#8221; because the more links your website has, the better you can then rank on Google.</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t like this, as you can imagine. Google wants their search results to be based on the algorithm and tries very hard to prevent that algorithm from getting gamed. Links, according to the &#8220;White Hat SEO&#8221; theorem that we subscribe to, should be earned.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2158" title="Every Time You Buy Links Matt Cutts Kills a Kitten" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/matt-cutts-kills-kittens.jpg" alt="Matt Cutts Kills A Kitten When You Buy Links" width="570" height="429" /></p>
<p><span id="more-2157"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a dramatic contrast between the two points of view, where one side wants to game the system for easy rankings, the other side strives to earn the rankings so as not to run the risk of being penalized by Google (see above, poor kittens).</p>
<p>So you can imagine my surprise when I find these links, all of which were clearly not placed because they were earned, or because this website was choosing to link to them out of any sort of relationship, but instead these links were paid for, and that <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=66736" target="_blank">goes against Google&#8217;s Webmaster Guidelines</a> on manipulating PageRank.</p>
<p>Google says pretty clearly, &#8220;<em>Buying or selling links that pass PageRank is in violation of Google&#8217;s Webmaster Guidelines and can negatively impact a site&#8217;s ranking in search results.</em>&#8221; I don&#8217;t know about you but I&#8217;m not willing to risk the success of my website, of our clients websites, by &#8220;cheating&#8221; at SEO for temporary gain.</p>
<p>As I typically do I reached out to my Facebook friends, I connected with a hidden Facebook group Image Freedom runs for people we connect with at conventions called SEO Secret Sauce, and I reached out to some experts. I didn&#8217;t exactly get the answer I wanted.</p>
<p>One of my friends, and I won&#8217;t out him here (though knowing him he&#8217;ll out himself via the comments) told me that when it comes to buying links your job is to not make Google look stupid. That if your website has a few Paid Links, but also has other organic SEO that you&#8217;ll be fine. The trick is, according to my friend, to not be obvious about it and to use it as a leg up to boost your otherwise White Hat SEO tactics.</p>
<p>What pissed me off is that what he said made a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense but it goes against everything that Rand Fishkin and the SEOmoz folks teach. It goes against the label of &#8220;White Hat SEO&#8221; and it was very much NOT what I wanted to hear.</p>
<p>I kept asking around.</p>
<p>An SEO who I very much look up to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindzie" target="_blank">Lindsay Wassel</a> from <a href="http://keyphraseology.com/" target="_blank">Keyphraseology</a> told me that the thing to remember is that in all things SEO, it&#8217;s a marathon and not a sprint. That even though I&#8217;m looking at this example of Black Hat SEO succeeding right now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the more they push that envelope the more they&#8217;re also inviting Google&#8217;s wrath.</p>
<p>Again, this was good advice, but it was NOT what I wanted to hear. I wanted to know that there was a magical Matt Cutts button somewhere (Matt Cutts is the head of Google&#8217;s Web Spam Team) that shined a light in the sky and magically all the bad SEO tactics would be kicked in the groin.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t what I was told however, so I kept asking around.</p>
<p>I reached out to some professionals that I look up to very much, and again not going to out them here, but I was told by one popular SEO blogger that in his 15 years experience he&#8217;s seen <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/paidlinks" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s Paid Link reporting tool</a> only work about ten to fifteen percent of the time.</p>
<p>Yet again, this was NOT what I wanted to hear.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2162" title="Join The Dark Side" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/129024691615173414.jpeg" alt="Join The Dark Side - We Have Cookies!" width="499" height="294" /></p>
<p>I was down. I&#8217;ll be honest. The team here can tell you that my White Hat SEO bubble was on the verge of breaking. So much emphasis on content, so much emphasis on Social Media and earning positive reviews, building relevant links, all of it, hung in the balance.</p>
<p>Finally I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tomcritchlow" target="_blank">Tom Critchlow</a>, one of the few SEO&#8217;s who I will pay a thousand dollars to attend an event, hell five thousand if I take our whole team, just for the chance to see Tom speak. His talks at LinkLove in New Orleans this year were fantastic and I look very much forward to seeing what he and the Distilled team have in store for us at <a href="http://www.distilled.net/events/searchlove-new-york/" target="_blank">SearchLove in New York</a>.</p>
<p>I reached out to Tom and I told him that I was down and starting to wonder if Rand Fishkin&#8217;s content powered socially driven White Hat SEO dream wasn&#8217;t in reality a Peter Pan fantasy.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tom set me straight.</p>
<p>Tom asked me point blank if the website I was optimizing for deserved to beat this company that was using Black Hat SEO. I paused for a moment, &#8220;Deserved?!&#8221;, I thought. They&#8217;re doing Black Hat SEO, of course they don&#8217;t deserve to&#8230; oooooh.</p>
<p>This is when Tom told me what I&#8217;d been waiting to hear.</p>
<p>I took a step back and I looked at the two sites side by side, I looked at the other competitors against our client&#8217;s site and to be honest, there are still some things that we have in the works but that haven&#8217;t yet been fully implemented to help our client DESERVE to rank higher on Google than these other sites.</p>
<p>I was looking back, I was turned around, and when you&#8217;re turned around, you can&#8217;t take a step forward. Tom told me about Good To Great, a book by Jim Collins, and talked about the Flywheel concept. The Flywheel concept is that if you ever stop pushing the wheel, if you&#8217;re ever not making forward progress, you&#8217;re killing your momentum.</p>
<p>By worrying about these Black Hat tactics, I was not pushing the Flywheel for our client. I wasn&#8217;t helping them develop their blog, or their mobile site, I wasn&#8217;t helping them earn positive reviews from their clients.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t doing my job.</p>
<p>Tom held a mirror up and asked me if I deserved that which I was going after, and the answer, I&#8217;m sorry to tell you, was no. I had, and have, a lot of work to do for this particular client, who lives in a very competitive local space against large sites who have been doing SEO for years.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;ve exhausted every tactic, built every organic link that we can build, received citations and reviews and written blogs and&#8230; you get the idea. If I&#8217;d done all that, and was still beaten by these Black Hat tactics, then maybe I can doubt what Rand Fishkin represents, what Distilled teaches at their events, but I clearly wasn&#8217;t there yet.</p>
<p>SEO can be a frustrating industry because you take action today and you may not see results until 30 or even 60 days later. Google, as amazing as their tool is, is still fairly slow.</p>
<p>So I brushed myself off, I went back to the lab as Eminem would say, and I faced forward, choosing not to worry about what the competitors were doing, how they might be cheating to win, until I&#8217;d exhausted every tactic that White Hat SEO&#8217;s execute on every single day.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I thought I&#8217;d reach out to those local TV stations that were selling Paid Links on their homepage. TV stations in the past had been great clients and they probably had no idea that what they were doing could potentially hurt their own rankings on Google.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d spent nine months last year consulting with another local station here in San Antonio and I reached out with the open heart that if I shared Google&#8217;s Webmaster Guidelines with their web team that maybe they&#8217;d join me in the White Hat SEO race.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting. One of the two TV stations, their webmaster to be specific, forwarded my contact information over to our client&#8217;s competition. My phone rang and on the other end of the phone was a very upset businessman wondering why I was trying to out his Black Hat paid links to these local TV stations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;m not proud of it, but I was amused as hell.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2168" title="Man-Angry-at-Computer-on-Phone-in-Office" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Man-Angry-at-Computer-on-Phone-in-Office.jpeg" alt="" width="324" height="182" /></p>
<p>He went on a small rampage yelling into the phone, asking me if I wanted to go to war with him and tried to intimidate me with stories of his service with the Air Force as a Combat Controller (I was in the Air Force myself). Here I was, worrying about him doing these Black Hat tactics when clearly he was more afraid of me doing the opposite, so afraid that he&#8217;d call up a total stranger and threaten acts of violence over his ranking on Google.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that old saying that the Bear is more afraid of you than you are of it. I had really gotten under his skin. White Hat SEO was as scary to him as his Black Hat SEO had been to me.</p>
<p>He knew he&#8217;d gotten caught. He knew people were starting to ask questions and were drawing attention to his link buying activities. The proof was right there in his Open Site Explorer link profile. He&#8217;d failed to stop Google from looking stupid and he knew it.</p>
<p>My epiphany came at the cost of a little drama, a few physical threats and a few lost hours, but my faith in White Hat SEO was completely restored. My belief in everything that I&#8217;ve stood for over the last two years was reinforced and I saw, staring the bear in the face, that he truly was more afraid of me than I had been of him.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the right side of the fence, our results speak for that, and I won&#8217;t be making a change to the dark side any time soon.</p>
<p><strong>Want to hear Tom speak?</strong> &#8211; Tom Critchlow and other SEO greats like Rand Fishkin, Wil Reynolds, Michael King, Laura Lippay and more will be presenting at the <a href="http://www.distilled.net/events/searchlove-new-york/" target="_blank">New York SearchLove Conference</a>. The entire Image Freedom team will be there and we&#8217;d love to see you there too. <a href="http://www.distilled.net/events/searchlove-new-york/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for info on tickets and accomodations.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED</strong> &#8211; We have received confirmation that one of the two TV stations carrying &#8220;paid links&#8221; on their homepage has made the offending link &#8220;no follow&#8221; after talking with us, so score one more for the White Hat effort!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re crushing on Cary Elwes as the <strong>Dread Pirate Roberts</strong> or simply love watching a good sword fight, it&#8217;s hard to deny that The Princess Bride is easily one of the Top 10 Cult Classics of our generation.  That said, The Princess Bride can also teach us a lot about <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> too.  No really, I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, this film <strong>can</strong> help you reach the top on Google!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2069" title="Inigo Montoya Princess Bride SEO Google Page 1" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Inigo-Montoya-graphic.jpg" alt="Inigo Montoya Princess Bride SEO Google Page 1" width="555" height="455" /></p>
<h3><span id="more-2068"></span></h3>
<h3>Chick&#8217;s love a good sword fight</h3>
<p>Cary Elwes and Inigo Montoya himself, Mandy Patinkin, spent most of their downtime during the films production learning swordfighting skills for the films many fencing scenes.  This dedication to a specific talent, a specific skill is a great example of a little energy investment that goes a long way.</p>
<p>We can take this and easily apply it to the SEO world.  What are your talents?  What are your skills that help you stand apart?  Inigo Montoya and the faux Dread Pirate Roberts were both extremely skilled swordfighters, but were it not for their skill, perhaps the film would not have been as memorable.</p>
<p><strong>What makes you memorable?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As I&#8217;ve always said, &#8220;if you&#8217;re worth talking about, you&#8217;re worth linking to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every business, every person, every team is unique when set beside another, and these differences are where we can find opportunities to build links to our site.  You don&#8217;t have to be a master swordfighter like Inigo Montoya to have won an award for racing model cars or have biked across the country for charity.</p>
<p>Who are you?  What makes <strong>you</strong> stand apart?</p>
<p>Focus on that, wave your <strong>Purple Cow</strong> freak flag, and use that to build relationships, earn links from bloggers, and prove that you are <em>someone of consequence</em>.</p>
<h3>Play To Their Ego</h3>
<p>Ego can be one of the most valuable tools in an SEO&#8217;s arsenal, and Princess Buttercup&#8217;s <em>one true love</em> knew to play to the kidnapper Vizzini&#8217;s ego in order to outwit him.  You don&#8217;t need a battle of wits (to the death) to play to someone&#8217;s ego.</p>
<p>Networking, blogger outreach, relationship building, and all of these avenues to building valuable links are helped along with a little ego bait.</p>
<p>Going back two years now to when Image Freedom first got started, I wrote a glowing review for 37Signal&#8217;s BaseCamp software.  37Signal&#8217;s posted my kind words on their blog, and just like that, one of the best links I&#8217;ve ever built was created.</p>
<p>Consider creating content, a review, a love letter, anything that might gain the affection of your intended audience.  I&#8217;ve fed carefully worded tweets to Dave Ramsey fans knowing they&#8217;d retweet the fiscally savvy URL I was optimizing.  I&#8217;ve dropped peoples names in blogs, knowing that they&#8217;d want to share with their Facebook friends that I&#8217;d mentioned them here, etc.  It&#8217;s all about the Ego Bait.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083" title="Miracle Max Playing to Their Ego for SEO" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Miracle-Max-and-His-Wife-the-princess-bride-53260_600_331.jpg" alt="Miracle Max Playing to Their Ego for SEO" width="555" height="306" /></p>
<p><strong>Inigo Montoya baited Miracle Max&#8217;s ego</strong> to get him to revive Wesley hoping that Wesley might embarrass Prince Humperdinck, who had embarrassed him.  Ego is a great way to get someone to drink from your poisoned goblet, and in a much less deadly way, can create for you extremely valuable backlinks.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t let it go to my head</h3>
<p>Whether your father was slaughtered by a six fingered man, or you&#8217;re eternally joined by the bonds of love, you can easily learn from The Princess Bride and other cult classics how to earn more backlinks and in turn improve your rankings on Google.</p>
<p><strong>Have fun storming the castle.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently we launched our <a href="http://www.imagefreedom.com/seo-meta-tool" target="_blank">SEO Meta Tool</a> which was custom made to help you figure out if your title and description were up to par with SEO best practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/metatool.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2050 aligncenter" title="metatool" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/metatool.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="238" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-2049"></span></p>
<p>Do me a favor real quick, search for your website in Google.</p>
<p>Go ahead. I&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>Ok, if you happen to see your title is being cut off or your description is trailing off into the darkness, then they&#8217;re too long and need to be shortened. In the image above you&#8217;ll see that the tag &amp; description for our home page is correct. However, as you can see the ADD CEO that he is, Matthew has neglected our blog&#8217;s homepage in the meta description department.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t tell him if you won&#8217;t. <img src='http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Anyway, while you may have learned from some random article on the web that it&#8217;s ok to leave it longer so that you “entice” the reader into wanting more and inevitably clicking&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t really work that way.</p>
<p>When a consumer does a search, they&#8217;re looking for instant gratification. They need to know what they&#8217;re looking at and which site will give them the information they need.</p>
<p>Extending your title and description so they trail off just makes consumers angry, not willing.</p>
<p>So what exactly should be in the title tag and description in order to show off exactly who you are and what you do while still targeting for your main keywords?</p>
<p>First, you&#8217;ll choose your primary keyword and place it in front of your name.</p>
<p>Example, for us, our title tag is: “San Antonio SEO Company | Image Freedom | Results-driven Web Marketing”.</p>
<p>That sentence alone tells a consumer what they would be expecting once they enter the page. Plus, Google picks up your main keywords at the front of the title tag.</p>
<p>The description should be a continuation of your title. It should be written with the users in mind; straight and to the point. No keyword stuffing! Cramming lots of keywords in your meta description does not help your ranking. It&#8217;s as useless as the meta keyword tag, Google doesn&#8217;t use it at all anymore.</p>
<p>We believe that simply changing a pages title is the absolute an easy place to start in your SEO venture. Just changing the title tag alone can increase your ranking by several pages.</p>
<p>So, go check out the free <a href="http://www.imagefreedom.com/seo-meta-tool" target="_blank">SEO Title &amp; Description Meta Tool</a> and let us know how your site measured up!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday via <a href="http://www.facebook.com/imagefreedom" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.neoviasolutions.com/" target="_blank">Holly Hoffman</a> asked us: &#8220;Are there any SEO pros or cons to having the www. or not? Some sites do and some don&#8217;t.&#8221; Today&#8217;s video addresses that and talks a bit about the canonicalization mess many websites find themselves in.</p>
<p><span id="more-1976"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/26682952?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The question, ultimately, is about which version of your URL do you want to give people. In every single case, whatever you do choose, both versions need to take you to the same place. So if I were to decide to drop the www. from ImageFreedom.com, I&#8217;d want to make sure that www.imagefreedom.com still sends users to the same place, which includes sending Google to the same place.</p>
<p>The problem arrises when you don&#8217;t have your .htaccess file properly setup to forward you to either all www. or all without the dubs. People then link to your website both ways and Google sees the two different ways of getting to your site as two different sites entirely. This is understandably bad.</p>
<p>What happens is, Google gives you X authority to the version with the www. and Y authority to version without, and you divide your authority across these two URL&#8217;s. They are the same singular page of course, but setup wrong so that Google gets confused and thinks they are different.</p>
<p><strong>The solution to this the rel canonical tag.</strong><br />
Example: <em>&lt;link ref=&#8221;canonical&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.imagefreedom.com/&#8221; /&gt;</em></p>
<p>This line of code goes in your website header, and you choose the URL you want that page to represent. This goes for more than just your homepage, you want each of your websites pages to have a canonical tag with the proper URL placed in that <em>href</em> section.</p>
<p>Now that you have canonical tags in place, anyone linking to your website, as long as the link takes you to the page, will tell Google that even though the link is for one variation of the URL, what you want them to remember is the one you provided in your canonical tag.</p>
<p>A lot of SEO is very simple, I smile often when I see a quick fix for a client that I know is going to improve their rankings in a short period because they had one little thing setup wrong.  The canonical tag or improper canonicalization is one such low hanging fruit fix and I recommend it&#8217;s use on every site you build!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Domain extensions, like .com and .net are almost as old as the internet itself.  We&#8217;re very used to visiting Google.com or CNN.com, or in my case <a href="http://www.bigbadtoystore.com/" target="_blank">BigBadToyStore.com</a>.  Typically you see businesses with a .com, but does the .com help your SEO, or is it just a preferred extension for businesses?</p>
<p><span id="more-1968"></span></p>
<p>The debate is old, I&#8217;m a snob and I do my best to build sites and recommend to our clients that they build sites that represent the easiest URL for a customer to remember.  I&#8217;m not a fan of .co or .net even, I believe that customers expect a .com.  We were talking earlier on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/imagefreedom" target="_blank">Facebook</a> about this topic and <a href="http://www.rerockstar.com/" target="_blank">Matt Stigliano</a> commented; &#8220;<em>The only danger is that people won&#8217;t remember the .net and use .com and then get frustrated. &#8220;Don&#8217;t Make Me Think&#8221; rules still apply, even as we get more tech savvy.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>A company here in San Antonio recently launched using a .co domain, but when you visit the same URL as a .com you wind up at another company entirely that does pretty much the same thing.  That company is going to lose potential clients to the confusion of sending visitors to the wrong website and ultimately their SEO efforts will be hurt when the ease of use factor kicks in, like Matt says above, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Make Me Think&#8221;.</p>
<p>That said, on the SEO front, Google could care less what your extension is.</p>
<p>People often ask if a .edu or .gov domain has some sort of built in bonus from Google, but ultimately that bonus comes from the content of the website, not the domain extension.  Logically, a school with a .edu or a government page with a .gov is going to be linked to by other school or government pages, it&#8217;s going to be referenced in dozens or hundreds of places and with that comes a sizable SEO boost.</p>
<p>Also, .edu and .gov domains tend to be fairly old.  The age of your domain is a factor in it&#8217;s value in Google&#8217;s eyes, so it&#8217;d make sense that a University with an older .edu domain would have built up ample authority over the years.  Whenever you buy a new domain with no history, you&#8217;re starting from scratch.</p>
<p>Bloggers are a big fan of the .me extension, and while the user might still put in .com when looking for your website, the .me extension doesn&#8217;t limit your SEO potential.  At the end of the day, the links to your site, the content on your site, and how frequently you post and update your content is going to make a much larger impact on your Search Rankings than a .com, a .co, or even a .edu.</p>
<p>When I named Image Freedom I had a spreadsheet of names that were available via GoDaddy.  Our company was almost called FlightFive, simply because the domain was available as a .com.  The snob in me recommends using a .com if the option exists, but if your content is sound and you can get the links, the domain extension doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if Google sees people visit your website, but quickly bounce off to another site or do another similar Google search, they&#8217;re going to know that your site wasn&#8217;t the most ideal place to send visitors for that keyword. This is where great web design pairs together with great SEO, because Google wants to send people to the best site possible, and if you neglect one, you&#8217;re going to pay the price in lost traffic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Google+ bandwagon is accepting new residents by the hour.  Posts exist calling out how Facebook&#8217;s days are numbered, or how it&#8217;s LinkedIn that should really be afraid of Google+, etc.  Everyone has an opinion, typically a strong one, and typically formulated without much actual time spent on Google+ or with the ear of decision makers at Google who could actually back up their theories.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/justin-timberlake-as-sean-parker_blog.jpg" alt="" title="justin-timberlake-as-sean-parker_blog" width="397" height="299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1840" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Link Bait folks.  The more outrageous the title of my blog is, the more likely it is to get clicked on, the more likely it is to be shared on Facebook or retweeted.  We live in a sensationalist world, and the immediacy of the social web simply feeds into that.  Sex sells, the death of SEO sells, the downfall of Facebook, all of this crap &#8220;sells papers&#8221; in the form of blog pageviews and social site backlinks.  All of this hype is people trying to get a piece of the Google+ pie.</p>
<p><span id="more-1837"></span></p>
<p>I hang out with a lot of Social Media folks, and of course we have our own social enthusiasts on staff, not excluding myself.  Google+ has been a hot topic.  It&#8217;s Google, so it&#8217;s search, but it&#8217;s a Social Network, so it&#8217;s social.  This isn&#8217;t anything new however, as Google has been scraping Twitter and Facebook for a while now.  What it is, most importantly, is the mainstream combination of Search Engine Optimization and Social Media.</p>
<h3>Yay!  I&#8217;m on Google+.  Now what?</h3>
<p>Google has a long way to go to &#8220;beat&#8221; Facebook.  The biggest hurdle right now with Google+ is that folks have developed the habit of sharing their toilet routine and whether or not their boyfriend is neglecting them to swing dance with strangers via Facebook.  Sure, people Tweet, but Twitter&#8217;s 140 character limit carved out a specific microblogging niche that has allowed Facebook and Twitter to co-exist without issue.</p>
<p>Google+ is also going to have to compete with the Billion Dollar industry that is Facebook gaming, companies like Zynga who develop Mafia Wars and f&#038;$%ing Farmville which addict and distract a bored audience into spending countless hours on Facebook, keeping a consistently refreshing audience to then comment on your sharing of your toilet routine and relationship drama.</p>
<p>Google+ needs eyes, and right now it doesn&#8217;t have them.  The whole &#8220;invite only&#8221; angle has been fantastic, and the addition of Video Chat and the very innovative circles setup has allowed Google+ to come out swinging, especially on the privacy front.  That said, blogs are popping up talking about how Android phones that are used to take a photo automatically upload that photo to Google+, without your permission, without you asking it to.</p>
<p>How long before some underage girl uses her Samsung Epic to snap an inappropriate picture of herself to &#8220;sext&#8221; to her boyfriend before that winds up on Google+ and Fox News goes ballistic.  I imagine Nancy Grace would even stop whining about the Casey Anthony verdict long enough to crucify Google with a &#8220;why won&#8217;t anyone think of the children&#8221; fury.</p>
<p>Back in January of 2010 I was published in Entrepreneur Magazine talking about <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2010/january/204332.html">Google Chrome and my fears about privacy</a>.  It&#8217;s ironic now that Google is trying to come out as the &#8220;privacy enabled&#8221; social network when they so desperately want your data to enhance their advertising products.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re approaching an age where the advertising depicted in the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report isn&#8217;t far from reality.  No one is talking about what Google wants, why Google would enter the Social Network race against Facebook and their partnership with Bing.  Google wants to track your behavior.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/minority-report-ads.jpg" alt="" title="minority-report-ads" width="468" height="197" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1844" /></p>
<p>If Google knows what you do, and because you have a Google+ profile cookie running in the background of all your browsing behavior, they can better target their paid advertising to you.  No longer catering ads by state, or city, or zip code, but down to &#8220;fans of Jersey Shore&#8221;, or people ages 18-34 who liked Firefly but didn&#8217;t care for Star Trek.</p>
<p>This is what Google wants, and this is the motivation behind Google+ at the end of the day.  The more of your behavior Google can map out, the better they can predict what you&#8217;re into, and what you&#8217;d buy, or what you&#8217;d not buy, the more money they can make off of you as a single user exposed to their advertising.</p>
<p>Google Chrome, the operating system not the browser, is all about tracking your information, your behavior.  Google Chrome, the browser, is all about Google knowing where you go, how long you stay there, etc.  Google Analytics is all about gathering data.  Do you think Google builds these tools because they love us?  Of course not!  Google Analytics might be free to use, but we&#8217;re giving Google our data in the transaction, and our data, our behavior, our essential online identity is something we haven&#8217;t really stopped long enough to value before.  We&#8217;re not even stopping to worry about it now.</p>
<p>Facebook, King of the Social Networks that it is, has signed a deal with Bing so that Bing Maps and NOT Google Places are fueling the map listings on Facebook.  Facebook has blocked Google from crawling your posts and likes and shared links, but Microsoft has the relationship with Facebook that allows Bing access to that data.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about Google+.  I don&#8217;t want to come across as a naysayer, or a conspiracy theorist, but ultimately Google doesn&#8217;t want to build a Social Network as a favor to you, they want to gather as many eyes as they can so they can generate a profit off of your boredom.  This hinders me from becoming a bandwagon evangelizer of Google+.</p>
<p>Sorry Scarlet, I know you want to believe that SXSWi just springs out of the ground miraculously and unfunded, that Facebook is a public service as reliable as the United States Postal Service or that Google is out to provide you with any more than one more way for THEM to collect your data.  All of these things are FOR PROFIT businesses.</p>
<p>Google is JUST a business at the end of the day.  Sure they make $29 Billion a year in profits, like no other, but Google is just a business that sells internet advertising.  The whole reason the search engine exists is so Google can get 5-15% of their users to click on those little paid advertisements that we&#8217;re so quick to ignore.  How likely are you to ignore an advertisement if it references your favorite TV show?  What if it knows you&#8217;re a dog person and hate cats?  Welcome to the future of advertising, care of Google+.</p>
<p>Are you excited to jump on the Google+ bandwagon?  Hurray!  Just don&#8217;t forget why the thing exists in the first place, it isn&#8217;t to give you a place to socialize, it&#8217;s to create yet another data source that Google can leverage to better sell advertising to businesses that want your money.</p>
<p>Kinda makes me miss the &#8220;Hit the Monkey with a banana to win an iPod&#8221; days.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every two years <a href="http://www.twitter.com/seomoz" target="new">SEOmoz</a> polls a bunch of SEOs on what we believe influences Google&#8217;s search rankings. They assembled new data today and have released their <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors" target="new">2011 Search Ranking Factors</a> report to the masses. We&#8217;re always very excited by this chance to see a community overview of what makes Google tick.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full rel=" title="2011 Overall Ranking Algorithm" src="http://www.imagefreedom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/2011-Overall-Ranking-Algorithm.png" alt="" width="560" height="273" /></p>
<p>The ranking factors are fairly complicated, a lot of you aren&#8217;t SEO junkies like we are, so I wanted to break down a few of the really important details from the report.</p>
<p><span id="more-1701"></span></p>
<h3>Not at all shocking &#8211; Social Media</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that I&#8217;ve been blogging a lot about Social Media lately, and there&#8217;s a reason for that. <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors#metrics-4" target="new">According to the report</a>, Facebook Shares and Facebook Activity are the highest correlated social ranking influencers for Google. Things like Tweets, Google Buzz, and Topsy also play a roll, as well as Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;like&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>This comes as no surprise as the search engines are scrambling to become more social to compete with the social networks for mindshare. Facebook is taking time away from Google and a company&#8217;s Facebook page is often found before their web site, which means Google is cut out of the interaction, and they aren&#8217;t thrilled about that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very important to have a sound social media presence, but that doesn&#8217;t mean jumping on every bandwagon out there. Instead, find the content that is going to engage your audience. The better your content, the more shares you will get, adding value.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE &#8211; </strong>During <a href="http://searchmarketingexpo.com/advanced/">SMX Advanced conference</a> in Seattle Google&#8217;s Matt Cutts mentioned to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dannysullivan" target="_blank">Danny Sullivan</a> that <a href="http://searchengineland.com/its-not-he-said-she-said-over-google-rankings-facebook-shares-80601" target="_blank">Google is unable to gather data on Facebook shares</a>.  This has created a considerable controversy, and SEOmoz&#8217; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/randfish" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin</a> has been running tests using only Facebook shares from a public fan page to test Mr. Cutt&#8217;s statements.  As of 8AM Central time on June 8th, Rand&#8217;s original Facebook post shows up on Google, but not the link he shared in that post. (This limited data supports Matt Cutts&#8217; statements)</p>
<p>This leaves me with two theories.  Pages with a lot of shares are high quality, thus also attract links, thus rank better, OR, Google does use Facebook shares or if not shares themselves, then &#8220;likes&#8221; or other publicly accessible Facebook data to influence search rankings and gauge a pages value.  Interesting stuff!</p>
<h3>A Crappy Web Site Will Hurt You</h3>
<p>When someone searches Google, if they click on your site and Google notices they search again on Google within a short time, that tells Google that they did not like what they found on your site. Google is giving points to sites who when clicked, hold the audience longest. Google wants to send users to what they want, and if you have a high bounce rate, if your site isn&#8217;t very good, Google is now holding that against you.</p>
<p>It has never been more important to have an effective landing page experience for your visitors. Do you have clear calls to action? Do you share all the pertinent information quickly? Is your site easy to navigate? Is your content well labeled?</p>
<p>Do you even have any worthwhile content?</p>
<p>It is very exciting on Google&#8217;s part, that ranking #1 isn&#8217;t guaranteed if once people click on your site they quickly go somewhere else. Spammy link tactics and tricks that push you higher on Google artificially are worth less than ever because even if your site ranks on the first page, you&#8217;ll quickly lose that position if your Bounce rate and Time On Site indicates to Google that you don&#8217;t deserve that first page ranking.</p>
<h3>Backlinks &amp; Domain Authority Are Still King</h3>
<p>Looking at the above pie chart, only 14.94% of your position on Google comes from Keyword factors actually on your web site. Things like putting keywords in your Title Tag, at least 4 times in the content of your site, and in the alt text of your images only account for 14.94% of your ranking. Clearly keyword stuffing on-site isn&#8217;t the answer.</p>
<p>This hasn&#8217;t changed since 2009 where they had a similar finding that 15.04% of your ranking came from on-site Keyword Factors. Off site factors like how many backlinks you have and the anchor text used to link to you are important to your ranking.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to build an online reputation worth talking about. I&#8217;ve always said, if you&#8217;re worth talking about, you&#8217;re worth linking to. This is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843170/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thranggam-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=1591843170" target="new">Seth Godin 101</a>.</p>
<h3>So what do I do with this information?</h3>
<p>All web sites should follow our F.A.S. system: Find, Act, Share.</p>
<p><strong>First, can anyone FIND your web site?</strong><br />
The best looking site in the world is useless if no one can find it. Ranking well on Google is the key to new visitors and increased traffic, so SEO best practices and domain authority are key to ensuring that your site can be found by potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly, will visitors ACT on your web site?</strong><br />
Once they find your site, what action do you want them to take? If there are no clear actions to take to become your customer then that visitor is going to look elsewhere. We recommend obvious calls to action, not unlike the big red button <a href="http://www.imagefreedom.com/" target="new">on our homepage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, will visitors SHARE your link?</strong><br />
Social Sharing and traditional link building are still vitally important to the success of your site. It&#8217;s important that we create sites and content that are worth sharing, worth having a laugh over, worth building links to. If your site and your content are shared, you&#8217;re then a lot more likely to be found, and the cycle continues.</p>

<h3>The Circle of iLife</h3>
<p>If customers can&#8217;t find your site, they obviously can&#8217;t act on it, and they certainly can&#8217;t share it. If they can&#8217;t act on it, they&#8217;re not going to share it, and future users won&#8217;t be able to find it. If they don&#8217;t share it, then no one is going to find it, thus no one can act on it.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t pick out one piece and ignore the rest. Can they find it? Will they act on it? Will they share it? These are the right questions to ask for online success.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/daveramsey" target="new">Dave Ramsey</a>, well, you really should be.  Dave is the kind of speaker who breaks down a lot of &#8220;shoulds&#8221; and gives them to you in easy to follow steps.  His fame, of course, comes from talking about getting out, and staying out, of debt.</p>
<p>San Antonio is going to be host to the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/entreleadership" target="new">EntreLeadership</a> Master Series, a great place to learn directly from Dave how to <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/entreleadership" target="new">grow your business</a>.  I&#8217;ve just signed up for the program, and as I know many of you reading this might benefit, I wanted to share this video.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited!  The San Antonio Master Series takes place from November 13th through the 19th.  It&#8217;s a big workshop for sure, but when you think about how that might improve your business, and improve your life?  I couldn&#8217;t not go, especially with it being hosted at the beautiful Westin La Cantera!</p>
<p>If the full Master Series is too intense, consider joining us at the <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/entreleadership/information/city/Dallas/" target="new">1-Day workshop in Dallas</a> on September 30th.  There&#8217;s still a few tickets left to have lunch with Dave, I couldn&#8217;t help myself, how cool is that?!</p>
