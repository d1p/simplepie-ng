&lt;p&gt;[NB My insubstantial video hardly does it justice, so please do go see it for yourself!]&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9669724043</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9669724043</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 18:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title>This post started out just being a simple photograph of the...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqlsk1T6f71qlerzjo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post started out just being a simple photograph of the memorial sculpture built into the wall along Balham Station Road commemorating the bombing of the station during World War II (now known to most people through the film adaptation of Ian McEwan’s &lt;em&gt;Atonement&lt;/em&gt;).  In the process of trying to figure out when it was installed and find any information on the artist responsible, I was pleasantly surprised to encounter the Art on the Underground site from Transport for London.  What a treasure!  This, folks, is a government initiative done right.  It is literally packed with information on past, present and future exhibits, printed media, and permanent installations searchable by artist, date, station, line, etc. I could go on &amp; on, but it’s probably best if you go and discover it for yourself.  The click-thru is obligingly linked to the photo, so have at it, and let me know if you find anything more about the Balham work…&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9660494290</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9660494290</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 10:00:05 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title>[This is very poorly photographed, as the sun was conspiring...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lql9xd5gU21qlerzjo1_r1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This is very poorly photographed, as the sun was conspiring against me.  However, actual sunny days have been rarely featured this summer, so I will not complain or apologize, but simply admit to low quality and soldier bravely onwards.  Better photographs of the work abound on the Internet generally, and the artist’s site specifically.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now to business…. The ongoing projects to fill the empty Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square have been many things: record-setting (Whiteread’s &lt;em&gt;Untitled Monument (2001)&lt;/em&gt;, the largest object ever cast in resin), controversial (Quinn’s &lt;em&gt;Allison Lapper, Pregnant&lt;/em&gt;), and dubiously successful (Gormley’s &lt;em&gt;One &amp; Other&lt;/em&gt;, which I did actually quite like).  The artist chosen for the 2011 commission is Yinka Shonibare, a YBA who spent his early years in Nigeria before returning to London for art school.  With a Turner prize nomination, MBE, and exhibits at the Venice Biennale headlining his CV, his Fourth Plinth effort is his first public art commission.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although initially the sculpture creates a feeling of nostalgia and whimsy, this lighthearted first impression soon gives way to much deeper social commentary.  &lt;em&gt;Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle&lt;/em&gt; is a 1:30 scale model of Horatio Nelson’s flagship in the Battle of Trafalgar, HMS &lt;em&gt;Victory&lt;/em&gt;.  Its 37 sails are hand-stitched from vibrant, patterned fabrics traditionally associated with African dress, which the artist sources himself at Brixton markets.  Although in their modern setting these fabrics specifically connote African identity and independence, their history is actually much more complex: their design is based on traditional Indonesian batiks, which were taken back to Europe by their colonial occupiers, the Dutch, who produced them on a large scale and then exported them to West Africa. It is these historical references (the connections of HMS &lt;em&gt;Victory &lt;/em&gt;- Nelson[’s Column]-Trafalgar [Square], the cultural context of the fabrics, and the legacy of European imperialism (for England, aided in large part by Nelson’s victories) that begin to lead deeper consideration of what &lt;em&gt;Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle &lt;/em&gt;means to the modern viewer.  The artist himself considers the work a celebration of Britain’s rich multiculturalism and in the wake of this month’s riot and unrest, it’s good to be reminded of what London can be…&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9620824966</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9620824966</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2011 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><category>London</category><category>public art</category><category>sculpture</category><category>Yinka Shonibare</category></item><item><title>Cows on the roof &amp; a bike on the wall @ the Phoenix Inn,...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqlsu6ausb1qlerzjo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cows on the roof &amp; a bike on the wall @ the Phoenix Inn, Palace Street, SW1&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9580877995</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/9580877995</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2011 10:00:05 +0200</pubDate><category>London</category></item><item><title>When I was last in London, the National Gallery was doing a bit...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lql8a6DfaE1qlerzjo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; the National Gallery's 'living wall'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lql8a6DfaE1qlerzjo2_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; the explanatory half of the project wall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lql8a6DfaE1qlerzjo4_500.png"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; context view, via live webcam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lql8a6DfaE1qlerzjo5_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; textile wall by Claudy Jongstra&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was last in London, the National Gallery was doing a bit of building work and had come up with a highly unique way of (semi)hiding the necessary scaffolding: a living re-creation of one of their paintings.  They chose van Gogh’s &lt;em&gt;A Wheatfield, with Cypresses&lt;/em&gt; and installed over 8,000 plants on a large board covering the scaffolding.  Their soft, rustling textures and verdant tonality create a lush contrast with the highly polished granite and classicism of the building and the surrounding Trafalgar Square.  The installation’s somehow comforting scale and immediacy of access also makes the Gallery’s otherwise grand and imposing façade more relatable and inviting; the visitor feels drawn in by its natural elements and removed from the overcrowded and bustling Square behind them.  The Gallery’s site for the project (&lt;a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/van-gogh-painting-brought-to-life-as-living-wall"&gt;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/van-gogh-painting-brought-to-life-as-living-wall&lt;/a&gt;) has a little more information on the project and its sponsorship by GE: funding is a common problem in the arts these days, and I’m happy to see the NG and GE finding an interesting and engaging way of serving both their purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NG’s ‘living wall’ reminded me strongly of one of my favourite things in the new public library (the Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam): the textile wallcoverings by the artist Claudy Jongstra.  Commissioned for the building’s construction in 2007, the wallcoverings have the same effect as the vegetal van Gogh; they soften the modern lines and hard building materials of the OBA’s clean construction.  Although the OBA is full of great design, the placement of Jongstra’s textiles in the entry hall is particularly significant; it immediately tells the visitor that this building isn’t just about lines of texts and the stacked spines of books on a shelf, it’s for them, for the people who use these things.  The textiles are welcoming and soft, and meld the physical properties of the natural world with the esoterica of human knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Ed. Slight detour here, feel free to skip onwards by two paragraphs if you like.]  My previous experiences of London were almost entirely Tube-dependent.  The layout of the city &amp; physical relationship of one area to another are tricksy, to say the least, &amp; the design- (rather than geography-) led layout of the Tube map does nothing to help.  This is not an original comment, &amp; I won’t go into the oft-quoted details &amp; quibbles here, but the lack of relationship between what you see on the map &amp; the reality of London’s geography mean that (at least initially) it’s much easier just to move around the city, Tube stop-to-Tube stop.  Even with my A-Z, if I was in a rush (inevitable), it was better to not flip through pages of dense streetnames, &amp; just stick with what I knew.  This was maddening, as after living in New York I was used to knowing where I was &amp; being able to intuitively figure out how to get where I needed to go (uptown, downtown, across the park, over the river… easy).  I KNEW there must be a way of doing the same for London, but short of making flashcards of the A-Z &amp; quizzing myself, I couldn’t figure out what that way might be.  Until… the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go all Apple-enthusiast here, so don’t worry.  Although I’ve had an iPhone for a few years, the prohibitive data roaming fees and SIM-lockedness meant that I never used apps when abroad.  That changed in February when I bought an unlocked iPhone &amp; started making use of 3’s great deal which gives me 3000 texts, 300 minutes, &amp; unlimited data when I top up with £15.  Please can the Netherlands get a deal like that, sooner rather than later?!  But I digress even further… Within about 5 seconds I knew exactly where I was, how to walk where I wanted to go, and if I missed a turning or wanted to make a little detour on the way for whatever reason, I was easily back on course.  It was fantastic to actually see the city &amp; how it was connected, &amp; walking provided a context for what I was seeing that had been completely lacking previously.  With the notable exception of when I was hoofing it from Victoria to the British Library, when Maps autocorrected my destination to the British Museum (where I’d been the day before) without my noticing, it never let me down &amp; was an utter joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on one of these ramblings (Selfridges to the British Museum, Vietnamese coffee in hand) that I found the Paul Stolper Gallery (31 Museum Street, WC1).  I initially just breezed passed, but was caught by a painting that pulled me through the doors of the gallery to see more by the artist.  The artist in question is Andrew Hollis, &amp; that’s his &lt;em&gt;Interior with Dancers and Seated Figur&lt;/em&gt;e at the top of this post.  He has a few things hanging as part of the gallery’s group show, titled &lt;em&gt;In the Flesh&lt;/em&gt;, which comes down August 27th.  As is often the case, the photo does the painting no favours, but in life it is arresting.  The collage-like juxtaposition of highly finished figures &amp; the veiled environments they inhabit push the viewer in and out of physical space, while the emotional lives of the figures themselves continually engage the viewer &amp; draw them further into the reality of the painting.  The scale of the works is also compelling and relatable (the ones in the show are generally ca. 1.5m x 1m or so).  I wish I had been able to see more in person (one of my other favourites from the show is &lt;em&gt;Interior with Cots and Statue&lt;/em&gt;), but for now the online gallery will have to do, &amp; hopefully sometime soon I’ll get to see &lt;em&gt;Memory Darkness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Interior with Couple and Photographs&lt;/em&gt;) in the flesh, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist has a dense, philosophical explanation of the work, his influences, &amp; viewing which although interesting, did not substantively add to my engagement with the work. I’m choosing to see this as a good thing: the works are strong enough to stand on their own and don’t need pages of text to support them (refreshing, in these modern times!).  It’s good to see an artist actually spend the time to work things through and articulate what they’re thinking &amp; where the art is coming from, but it is interesting to note that many of the ideas and feelings he talks about are much more effectively communicated through the paintings themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No pointing fingers though, as this was dense, overlong, &amp; probably in need of some editing itself, so… Just leave it to the paintings themselves to do the explaining &amp; go see them or use the click through link to get more on Hollis &amp; his other work.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/8728322028</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/8728322028</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2011 10:49:00 +0200</pubDate><category>Andrew Hollis</category><category>Paul Stolper</category><category>Gallery shows</category><category>painting</category></item><item><title>London tease… Have returned from the UK full of things to say,...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp60li9T921qlerzjo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;London tease… Have returned from the UK full of things to say, but with not enough time to say them!

&lt;p&gt;Built into the wall of the Nieuwe Kerk, on a small square tucked in a corner between the Dam and the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, is Gild.  A small jewelry atelier run by Fraukje Teppema, Gild specialises in quietly striking contemporary designs, most of which are made by Teppema herself in the small but perfectly formed work space in a corner of the shop.  This is what I love about Gild - the connection between the goldsmith &amp; the visitor, the visibility of the tools &amp; materials, &amp; the carefully curated display of glittering things in lit cabinets &amp; under bell jars.  The website is &lt;a href="http://www.gild-atelier.com"&gt;www.gild-atelier.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp; if you’re lucky enough to be able to go in person, the shop itself is Eggerstraat 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/7499399404</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/7499399404</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2011 20:07:00 +0200</pubDate><category>Gild</category><category>Amsterdam</category><category>jewelry</category></item><item><title>Lighting up the Box</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zfty5"&gt;Lighting up the Box&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;The BBC has a pretty good track record on arts programming, but they have outdone themselves recently and are KILLING IT with two stellar new shoes: BBC One’s &lt;em&gt;Fake or Fortune&lt;/em&gt; and BBC Four’s &lt;em&gt;Agony &amp; Ecstasy, A Year with the English National Ballet&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Fake or Fortune&lt;/em&gt; is hosted by Fiona Bruce &amp; Philip Mould, who investigate a new painting each week.  The journalist/dealer dynamic works well, particularly when there’s a need for explaining how the art world ‘works.’  Conservation, technical art history, auction houses, historical research, provenance, law… everything gets covered in a thoroughly enjoyable way.  The paintings under examination are fascinating in &amp; of themselves, &amp; serve as an excellent platform for further discussion.  The case studies are genuinely interesting, even for someone in the field, &amp; there are dramatic &amp; surprising moments which, while obviously scheduled for filming, don’t feel overly contrived (a blessing in this age of slick, glossy, manufactured programs without any substance behind them). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agony &amp; Ecstasy&lt;/em&gt; is easily my new favourite program of the year.  They focus on a different production or aspect of the ENB each episode, and the style is more documentary than ‘reality tv’ (which is a relief, since there’s more than enough of that around these days).  I can’t quite articulate just how amazing the whole thing is… the dancers, rehearsals, administration, costuming, set design, etc. is a world unto itself &amp; the program does a great job of introducing us to everything without ‘dumbing it down’ too much.  One of things I enjoy most is the unobtrusive narration - most of the story is told by the members of the ENB themselves, and mostly in informal moments walking down halls, in the wings of the theatre between entrances, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realise that for those of us living outside the UK, these shows won’t necessarily be easy to get hold of, but where there’s a will there’s a way, and I do very much hope you’ll make the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/7337076795</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/7337076795</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2011 10:54:00 +0200</pubDate><category>BBC</category><category>television</category><category>English National Ballet</category><category>Fake or Fortune</category></item><item><title>I first saw Eva Kotatkova’s work at this year’s Art...</title><description>&lt;img src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnx28rxQAp1qlerzjo1_250.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnx28rxQAp1qlerzjo2_250.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnx28rxQAp1qlerzjo3_250.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnx28rxQAp1qlerzjo4_250.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnx28rxQAp1qlerzjo5_250.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnx28rxQAp1qlerzjo6_250.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first saw Eva Kotatkova’s work at this year’s Art Amsterdam, and just finally got around to looking at the rest of her portfolio.  I’m completely drawn in by what I found there, and wish I could see (more) things &amp; in person!  Originally from Prague, Kotatkova also studied in San Francisco and Vienna, and has had pieces in shows throughout Europe &amp; the US.  Her new work will be presented at Frieze Frame in London in October, by her gallerist Hunt Kastner.  Her exploration of environment, form, materials, and experience is captivating and engrossing, and made more interesting by the fact that (from reading her artist’s statement) it seems like just about everything she does starts out as a simple line drawing.  From there, she lets things lead where they will into three-dimensions.  Frieze Frame is in October, so there’s plenty of time to book tickets now!  She’ll also be featured in upcoming shows in Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, &amp; Slovakia, if you fancy something a bit further away. Otherwise, just check out the website (&lt;a href="http://www.huntkastner.com/en/artists/kotatkova/"&gt;www.huntkastner.com/en/artists/kotatkova/&lt;/a&gt;) and keep your eyes open for more….&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/7302834379</link><guid>http://theartseen.tumblr.com/post/7302834379</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2011 16:43:00 +0200</pubDate><category>Eva Kotatkova</category><category>Art Amsterdam</category><category>Amsterdam</category><category>sculpture</category></item><item><title>Get smArt</title><description>&lt;p&gt;And now for a bit of art that you can actually have for your very own… The pop-up Art Market is back!  And it’s this Sunday, July 10th.  Running (pretty much) all day, it’s got something for everyone &amp; it’s Trouw without the normal massive line (I hope)!  &lt;/p&gt;
