			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again geeks. Nyaha. It&#8217;s really weird, but most of my family/relatives&#8217; birthdays are on October! My 2 sisters, ~5 cousins, uncle, and aunt all celebrate their birthday on October. So when it&#8217;s October and you want to give gifts&#8230; dang. Go on a budget. If you buy one of the celebrants a birthday gift, you&#8217;ll have to buy the rest, too, or else they&#8217;ll get really jelly =p. If you&#8217;re like me, who knows a lot of people whose birthday&#8217;s on October, and you want to buy a gift, you should try looking for gifts ideas at GeekAlerts.com where they have <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/">Discount Promotion Codes and Cool Gadgets</a>! <img src='http://chiburger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  They have awesome coupon codes there! GeekAlerts isn&#8217;t really an online shop where you buy stuff, but they have news about cool gadgets. Y&#8217;know! To keep you updated on awesome geeky things. You can even try browsing the site just for fun when you are extremely bored! The stuff they post there -like the Public Toilet Survival Kit, Bed fan, Domo kun plush hat-Â  amuse me. They also have a lot of Doctor Who products for fans out there. Right now they have <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/proflowers-coupon-codes/">ProFlowers coupon code</a> and <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/tire-rack-coupon-codes/">Tire Rack coupon codes</a> that you could use.

If I do move to Ontario, I&#8217;m going to need to move out to live in Toronto. I wish it would happen. I just realized how hard it will be, though. I&#8217;m going to need to find a good place (what&#8217;s a good place? Any house or apartment with <a href="http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/TopmountStainlessSteelSinks.html">top mount sinks</a>!). Maybe a place easy to clean and has everything I need (Basic stuff and a <a href="http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/TopmountStainlessSteelSinks.html">top mount sink</a>, lol). Oh well. Need to save money.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I borrowed a book from this thrift store that I volunteer at. It&#8217;s called <i>Detox</i>. It says a lot about healthy diets and lifestyle, and the 7-Day detox diet and Weekend Refresher diet. It&#8217;s pretty cool because it has motivated me once again to go back to healthy eating habits. Of course, if I want to lose weight, I&#8217;ll have to move, too.</p>
<p>These days moving is such a problem to me. I need to sleep earlier so I&#8217;ll have energy for exercising the next morning. It&#8217;s sort of hard to do especially for lazy people like me (lol). Sometimes I wish I also have time for sports like <a href="http://sportsbettingspot.com/soccer/">Soccer</a> or Badminton (like DOING the sport, not just <a href="http://sportsbettingspot.com">sports betting</a>). I also want to sign up for Yoga, Pilates or Yolates classes. It&#8217;s sort of hard to keep a healthy lifestyle nowadays =_= What happened to the wooooorld?</p>
<p>I really should not stop on Planning. I&#8217;ve planned to much. I need to work on DOING it. I have to exercise and go back to my healthy eating habits. </p>
