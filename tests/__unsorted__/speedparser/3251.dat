If enough of us are asking to have accounts removed it might make Robert realise that we are now unhappy that Klout wont let us out.  Whilst my own Klout in social media influence was sufficient to erase my profile it seems not enough to get Jo to commit to agreeing that people may want to delete and remove their profiles are well.  So lets keep Klout ing Jo around the email until he understands our request.  if anyone else is stumbling upon this article or my own leave a comment on both blogs and then push out your own blog and link those to the klout articles you find.  Thanks for your time Brian. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Loudmouthman</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2011 04:27:06 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: SXSW: Do you *know* how influential I am?</title><link>http://corp.klout.com/blog/2011/08/sxsw-influence-joe-fernandez/#comment-288363614</link><description>but it turns out that you cant unlink from the network according to the instructions and you also cannot have your profile hidden not to be seen. there are promises that this might come in the future. It turns out this feature USED to be implemented and I could have a profile that no one else can see. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have contacted Klout to be told the above If I disconnect twitter from the account the score and the profile still stay active and visible to all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally I should point out that you have edited your own forums to remove previous conversations I have had on this topic. you have dodged and avoided this conversation several times in email and you simply do not accept that if someone asks for their klout profile to be utterly removed ( not simply network disconnected ) but fully 404'd on your website that this is a valid request. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this may not be the best forums but I think people who want to praise Klout should know that your handling of data removal requests is less than salutatory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Loudmouthman</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2011 17:00:35 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: SXSW 2012 - Do you *know* how influential I am?</title><link>http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/12410#comment-288266240</link><description>its great isnt it : you want to delete your profile and they never actually answer the question : &lt;a href="http://support.klout.com/customer/portal/questions/25931-how-do-i-delete-my-account-" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://support.klout.com/custo...&lt;/a&gt; somehow they keep spinning round the idea that you want to change your settings.

Along comes Windows Phone and it is easy to think of it as living in that ecosystem  unless you happen to be a developer who also owns an Xbox and has experienced Xbox Live and the Xbox Live Arcade. Now your looking at a phone that connects to the entertainment system which is linked to movies, games and a social network. Now your looking at a phone that works as the extension to Xbox Live and MS Live. You now have an application build that can push its architecture to touch on ecosystems outside of your phone infrastructure. Now that is interesting. When you talk to potential mobile developers of WinPhone ask them if they have are xbox live users as well?</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Loudmouthman</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 02:44:25 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Google v Microsoft; a question of ethics</title><link>http://www.1000heads.com/2011/05/google-v-microsoft-a-question-of-ethics/#comment-210610569</link><description>So your saying the strops and hissy fits that I threw as a three year old are indicators of my behavior now that I am nearly 40 ? well screw you mr poopy head ! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However I accept that you Mr Eden are far more enlightened and take the whole approach over the single events.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Loudmouthman</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2011 09:07:42 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Google v Microsoft; a question of ethics</title><link>http://www.1000heads.com/2011/05/google-v-microsoft-a-question-of-ethics/#comment-210567144</link><description>One was a developers confernce the other a promotional event. At one the recipients were likely to create and build and play with the technology at the other the recipients would be likely to write something positive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ethical question should not be addressed to the companies handing out freebies but to the recipients receiving them . Are their ethics compromised in accepting free ( and notably expensive ) goodies ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incidentally I have the morals and ethics of a backyard alley cat when it comes to being given free stuff from vendors and manufacturers but it doesnt mean I will lovel them any more for it.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Loudmouthman</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2011 07:55:24 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: The &amp;#8220;Computers&amp;#8221; Section of the Bookstore</title><link>http://allenc.com/2011/05/the-computers-section-of-the-bookstore/#comment-209707445</link><description>There came a moment when the Internet was 'just' ubiquitous enough in my routine and 'just' fast enough for my preferences when I stood in a book store and realised I didnt need to buy a book for anything more than fiction. Now I own a kindle and the delay between thinking of owning a book and its ownership is less than a minute ( for a given value  of that book being on Amazon ) and I have started to reclaim my shelf space at home.  I should , and am told , feel sad that some great 'thing' is being lost. The way I see it, I have  gained more and lost little.  Thanks for making me think about my books again</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Loudmouthman</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2011 02:23:11 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Hope for the Future: A Little Girl Who Hates Gender Stereotyping</title><link>http://www.themarysue.com/gender-stereotypes/#comment-196749895</link><description>My Daughter Alyssa is 7 , she hates buying clothes because they tend to be Pink or Girlie so she shops for boys shorts and trousers because they are blue. When we goto parties she asks for the boys party bags. She is a big Dr Who ( Tennant ) Fan and currently has me reading any Green Lantern and Blue Beetle comics she can get her hands on. Though our little boy of 2 is managing to meet many of the expected traits for 2yr old boys playing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither Sharon or I set out with an agenda for or against stereo typing and there are plenty of prams and dolls and makeup kits that Alyssa has inspected and ignored to testify to this. Whilst I am , as any parent would be , proud and happy with my daughters ( and Sons ) choices I know that Kids will be cruel and some teachers crueller ( is that a word ? ) so as parents we have to prepare Alyssa for the onslaught of pressure to accept and conform which we doubt she will take part in since she shows no interests ( yet ) .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whilst we see her playing with girls her own age we know that there will be some Girls who will pick on this perceived difference and Girls bullying can be socially insidious compared to a boys physical bullying.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love that my Girl asks for the comics she wants and knows the things that keep her entertained and with luck we can teach her that being an individual need not be a lonely experience through her early teens.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Loudmouthman</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2011 02:55:12 -0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Re: Dell's ultra-thin laptop will have a 15.6-inch screen, tread lightly on your wallet?</title><link>http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/03/dells-ultra-thin-laptop-will-have-a-15-6-inch-screen-ring-up-a/#comment-196734402</link><description>Lets just hope they fix the terrible terrible battery life that the Dell Vostro V130  suffer from.

If O2 are going to say it must be implemented on mobile then surely it cannot be so long before they concede they must enforce it on broadband. After that they are one more step away from conceding that they have to be responsible for what people download and access online and take steps to protect consumers from the perils of using Bit Torrent or peer to peer sites lest they inadvertently pirate content. then you are no more than a year away from the packet and wrapping of internet content by channels available to you on in several subscription packages.
