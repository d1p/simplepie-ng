			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>It was an honour to be asked to contribute an image for one of this years team T-shirts, in support of the 'Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure' (EL PASO). The team "Reigning Frogs" walked specifically to help fund research into breast cancer. </p>

<p>I'll post a picture of a T-shirt when I have one.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Old fashioned - &#039;New lamps for old&#039;]]></title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>A sketch with some simple colour added, picturing the moment when the old lamp is traded for a new one in Aladdin. It's a poignant part of the story, suggesting a deeper mistaking than at first glimpse.</p>

<p>Did we just give away something simply because it was old, for something new and far less special? Was there something sinister in that offer that was too good to be true..</p>

<p>(smoke and colour variants shown)
</p>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>Another quick drawing, this time inked line work with colour again added digitally.</p>

<p>I did versions with/without the arm pointing and also on light/dark backgrounds. The light background seemed better and works as spot illustration, but I'm still wondering about the arm. Produced for IF 'Proverb'.</p>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>A quick pencil drawing with some colour added digitally.</p>

<p>The aim was to capture the kind of expression seen when the dessert menu is handed to one of the younger family members. And perhaps some of us older members too..</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Skeggy the Viking]]></title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>Some images from recent character design work and artwork for Skeggy, a fun Viking character for use with and to help promote Skegness to younger audiences. The character is designed for print and web, but also with consideration given to future development as a skin (suit) character, after which the commissioning design company was able to implement and develop further.</p>

<p>The images show the final design (used initially in print as a postcard image), some variations in detail & line colour and some development sketches.
</p>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>Another sketch painted entirely in Photoshop, paying a little homage to the game played by the famous bear.</p>

<p>The line work takes a good deal longer than it would have if it had been produced pencil or vector, but there's more control over the subtleties of the line.</p>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>This sketch was painted in Photoshop, again just to play with colour and a little with texture.</p>

<p>To save time, the detail has been contained in very small areas (though these would benefit from more attention) and much of the remaining image has been left loose.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Artificial]]></title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>Back to more of a cartoon style for this pencil drawing, which was coloured digitally.</p>

<p>The styling lends itself to the use of vivid colours and humour, both of which I tried for here. Pencil is a lovely medium and I had fun both doing the line work and adding colour to it.</p>

<p>This could be tidied further, so please ignore the roughness where it shows.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Double vision]]></title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>This was intended as a compositional study using double focal points, with a diagonal divide between the softer left and more angular right sides of the scene.</p>

<p>As a sketch, the two sides were joined by a heavy wooden bridge (we all have at least one bridge drawing in us, so no doubt I'll be returning to this) but the scene seemed better with the connection being maintained only in the use of colour and the position of the light sources.</p>

<p>To add more contrast, the bridge supports were also removed and replaced with tree and foliage to help 'soften' the feel of the left side. The double headed beast (added for IF:Double) on the right adds to this contrast further.
</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Breakfast]]></title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>The initial drawing had smaller character unaware that the monster was behind, saying over his shoulder; "What you having for breakfast?", to make clear the intent in the story. The dark swoosh in the background was also much darker to give weight to the scene.</p>

<p>I much prefer the feeling in the final image - they are both aware of each other but there's still the sense that one more day of SpottyPops might just be too much. Our monster looks directly at his friend and seems to be thinking it over. And his friend knows it. I did toy with the sentence using a full stop; "It's SpottyPops again. I'm afraid..", but went with it as a single sentence.</p>

				<p>Another sample from a pencil sketch and coloured digitally.
I quite enjoyed playing with the colours and the alliteration was for fun too.
