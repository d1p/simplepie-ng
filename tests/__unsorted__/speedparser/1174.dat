&lt;p&gt;oh yes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) separate church and state-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time to call our country’s bluff! a true separation would mean a neutering of the institution of marriage into a religious formality and instituting civil-unions for everyone who wishes to become partners, gay or straight. time for EQUALITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) reform the EPA-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this environmental protection agency is anything but! corruption and antiquated concepts of environmental safety mean that this brilliant idea has become a joke. time to accurately measure environmental protection based on today’s science.  this agency COULD actually be enforcing sustainable practices across the country that would ACTUALLY save us from turning it all to shit. Its clear that humanities survival instinct is defunct and we really DO have to rely on some sort of enforcement agency to &lt;span&gt;protect&lt;/span&gt; ourselves. YOU COULD BE THE ONE EPA!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) reform the FDA-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why the hell is poisonous ass shit like aspartame allowed into our food? that’s some fucked up shit! why do we even have the FDA if they are going to lie and be bribed and let us poison ourselves unaware. did you know that these guys were recently BULLIED into allowing toxic shit like aspartame to be called “natural flavors” on our oh-so-friendly and informative packaging?? WTF??? if you are going to try to feed us fucked up shit at least tell us about it! and how about stopping us from eating pesticides, hormones, &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;GMOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and hostess cupcakes (recently had one, sure wish the FDA had stopped me, i gotta say) anyways, these guys gotta go. time for an overhaul folks! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) universal health care -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean COME ON. the rest of the progressive world has caught on that privatizing EVERYTHING doesn’t really work when humans are involved. we are to easily swayed by greed, not swayed enough by compassion. so our health insurance is a joke. Most of the modern word has realized that healthy people are productive people. And that companies wont ever put people before profits. i mean, I’m all for deciding where my money goes, but if we take private insurance companies out of the equation we can take care of everyone for a fraction of the price. because what do companies do? turn a profit. &lt;span&gt;that’s&lt;/span&gt; the whole point. so the more we spend, the more they make, the better everything is. right? WRONG. ya as corrupt as our government is, id still prefer an entity that was at least created under the idea of supporting its communities. companies were created to turn a profit, nothing more nothing less. they are incapable of altering that initial reason for being. insurance companies are no different. and don’t get me started on the fucking pharmaceutical bitches we call doctors. so so many of them are on the fucking drug companies payroll. WTF?? that should be illegal. it is technically called a conflict of interest i believe. anyways, universal health care is entirely possible especially if we ( segue please..)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) end the USA absurd global priorities -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;get our military out of the fucking whole worlds ass! i mean come on! billions upon billions of dollars go into some fucked up petroleum based agenda that CERTAINLY doesn’t reflect my interests. short on cash for making people healthy? simple answer: stop making people dead! i mean we have enough bombs to destroy EVERYTHING, so do we really need to be sending kids all over the fucking world fulfilling god knows what secret agenda? NO. We need to be investing in infrastructure, education, and innovation. time for a nation is like a snake eating a mouse. what we do takes a long time before finally coming out the other side. so 50 years ago we had a few good priorities that are still allowing us to be the top dog, but in 50 years? when all our kids are uneducated, &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;un&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;treated, and malnourished, when our car-based road systems are crumbling, and the rest of the world is light years ahead of us..where will this great nation be then? and oil? come on folks get with the times! which brings me to my next item:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) micro-solar economy-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sure the big solar grids are great, but if every single person owned a few solar apparatuses (which are getting better and better everyday!) we would need to rely a lot less on the huge Goliath of a national energy grid. ironically this SEEMS like it would fit the right-wing’s independent, every man for himself sort of mentality, but hey, that’s a different story. so lets just slap a shit ton of solar panels on EVERYTHING and where we are not slapping solar panels lets slap some air-filtering peace lilies and trees and BAM everything is looking a lot better, right? right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) national clean-tech transportation grid-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ya take that old-world power grid and turn it into a solar-run high speed light rail system! can you imagine zipping across the country in a day? watching the happy, clean skies and fresh blue waters of our country as we rush by? ya me to. sounds AWESOME! so why are we lagging so far behind the rest of the world in this matter? urban centers with high-speed rails connecting them is SO the future. and its sexy. and clean. a few have been started. but the resistance to this is..rather confusing..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) REAL campaign finance reform-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here’s an idea. how about an even playing field for presidential nominees? give them each the same amount of money to work with and THEN see how the country votes? the whole idea of buying your way into office just STINKS and goes against everything our forefathers had in mind. plus did you know each election there are like 10 people running for president? can you imagine if each of them had the SAME funding as the other. our two party system would finally crumble and allow this gridlock to disappear. maybe we could actually make some real change. so on my list for 2011 is no private fundraising for competing political figures, the same allotted campaign budget for EVERY candidate and then &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;i’ll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; just WATCH the elite squirm as the people finally get a clear and comprehensive look at who is going to be running our nation. making money and doing what’s right should NEVER be collapsed on top of each other. and yet, that is EXACTLY where we stand. its broken! lets fix it! campaign finance reform FTW!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; well that shouldn’t be to hard! I’m putting this on my fridge.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/2656930221</link><guid>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/2656930221</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2011 13:33:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>champagne or suicide..</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;last week i reached a breaking point. some of you may have seen my tweet (@&lt;span&gt;cassidyhaley&lt;/span&gt;) about my breakdown in MACY’S. it &lt;span&gt;wasnt&lt;/span&gt; pretty but it &lt;span&gt;wasnt&lt;/span&gt; quite as visually interesting as one might expect from a breakdown in MACY’S. it was very much internal. and it was the culmination of something &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; been struggling with for the last month or so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;every year around this time i reflect on how far &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; come and all the mistakes &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; made. the successes and the failures….and this year was no different. but what was different is that it was such an intense rush of finally doing the things &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; always wanted to do that this end of year wrap up was equally intense. i had to really come to terms with all the things that &lt;span&gt;didnt&lt;/span&gt; go right. the plans i made that never happened, the goals and aspirations that fizzled out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive learned so many lessons this year about how to do this thing called a music career. i just jumped head first into an industry ive always desired but never really experienced, and from day one it was one lesson after the other. And here i am, more than a year into it..and for a moment it was hard to see where i was going. i felt like giving up. i felt the challenges in front of me were too great. and in that numb and empty place, i wandered into a department store. now this may not seem out of the ordinary, but for me it really has huge significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;department stores and mall mentality are representative of everything i resist about our culture. mass appeal, consumerism, conventional thinking. conventional clothing. plastic wrapped EVERYTHING. fake smiles and perfume and tranquilizing music sedating you into submission. ya. you &lt;span&gt;dont&lt;/span&gt; find me in those sort so places very often. But here i was..so confused..so alone..grasping for some kind of grounding, familiar, safe environment..and it came in the form of MACY’S. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as much as i resist that culture it is as much a part of me as anyone in our country. department stores meant excitement to me when i was young. forgetting the world for those few minutes and BUYING something..being with family..so there i was, in this monolithic representation of our culture, of my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“why am I here?”  i asked the pretty rows of bath towels. so soft and matching to the hand towels, the soap dishes, and the myriad of other bath accessories..they seemed to be beckoning me into a world i knew nothing about..”&lt;span&gt;iVE&lt;/span&gt; NEVER PURCHASED MATCHING BATH TOWELS..” i thought to myself, suddenly feeling like id done something terribly wrong in life..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“whats wrong with me?” i mourned..but the towels gave no answer. they simply plumped and preened enticing me with thoughts of impressing house guests…so i stumbled on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“where am i going?” i asked the technologically savvy luggage that had FOUR wheels for ease of movement as the lady on the picture so clearly illustrated with her smiling, high-heeled (but not to high) brisk walk..SHE was going places. oh yes. somewhere exotic with an equally charming perfect husband..but alas, she gave no answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IVE NEVER PURCHASED MATCHING LUGGAGE”, i thought…suddenly feeling like i had failed life because of that fact. i was reminded of a time when everything i owed that was meant for moving or carrying stuff was the same color blue. that was nice. but alas, the luggage had no answer as well. i stumbled along..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;sipping my iced latte..my last &lt;span&gt;graps&lt;/span&gt; on reality..there were toys and cleverly designed suit garment bags..and appliances..appliances for EVERYTHING. “how could one person fit ALL these appliances in their house?” i wondered..but again, no answer was given.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and so, with only questions gained from my expedition, i dejectedly wandered out into the streets. wistfully brooding on the life &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; chosen..the path &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; lived..the fierce determination to be free, independent, to make my own way, to fight for what i believe in…”was it worth it?” i asked the tall tall buildings of downtown LA..(violins SURELY playing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;melancholic overtures somewhere just beyond my ears..)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;but all these grey giants gave me was enticement for a robust and epic journey of flying off the top of them. they seemed to mock my very will to l&lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“what the hell is it all for?” i leered back at them..tempted, but determined to find answers before making rash and deadly decisions..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;this startled me more than talking to towels and jet-setting luggage..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;even my &lt;span&gt;uber&lt;/span&gt;-angst filled youth awash in acne and loneliness never brought even the passing thought of suicide… yet here was, an adult. living my dream. healthy and otherwise…lamenting life itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;it all just seemed to much..the weight of the world and all its follies were so loud in my head i couldn’t see clearly..all the mistakes and hurdles i had yet to cross just pounded into me like some cruel madman lover..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;so naturally i went to the gym. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and there, finally, i found solace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WHY I HAVE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES AT THE GYM:                                                        1) &lt;/span&gt;my phone dies underground, leaving me unclouded by the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) i am stripped of my identity by wearing the uniform of gym shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)i regain control of the one thing that i always can…my body. no matter how far out of control everything else is…i can always control what i do with my body. and that has been my saving grace time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;so, here, among the strong and strong minded of downtown &lt;span&gt;LA’s&lt;/span&gt; gold gym..i discovered what was missing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;YES, i had contemplated suicide. I realized it was a natural reactionary thought to &lt;span&gt;tmy&lt;/span&gt; first thought of the day which was to become a dentist. or a waiter. to leave this life of uncertainty and risk behind for something safe, albeit boring.BUT,  i realized, as the treadmill carried me along to some far off destination, that THERE IS NOTHING ELSE for me. i realized that i would rather die than g&lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; up. THAT if the weight of everything i faced was too much to handle, then I might as well be dead. DO OR DIE, as they say..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and with this melancholy epiphany, so&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;mething shifted inside of me..a dawning of a realization, the stark reality that there was no turning back. that regardless of my immediate challenges,  &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; come to far to turn around. i &lt;span&gt;couldnt&lt;/span&gt; just g&lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; it all up and become a dentist. or a waiter. i literally would rather die than g&lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; up this journey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and suddenly i felt free. the weight was gone. no longer did the challenges seem life-crushing..suddenly they seemed liberating. like a rope hung from an impenetrable tower just within your reach when you are running from molten lava. these challenges are ACTUALLY the perfect thing that i need to experience in order to achieve my dreams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;and that my friends, is where i chose champagne. to celebrate. to succeed. to LIVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;dying to live folks, i wrote it and believed it, but i didnt really get how much it was a personal declaration as much as call to others. now i get it. i am going to fuck LIVE. im gonna DIE LIVING. and im fucking DYING TO LIVE. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and there you have it. everything changed in an instant. I strode home with a new confidence. a sense of purpose. my mind made up, and the fierce determination to succeed simmering in my veins. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The funny thing is, that with this new perspect&lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt;, i look back and as many mistakes as i made this year and as much as some things &lt;span&gt;didnt&lt;/span&gt; turn out exactly as i had planned, i did a whole shit ton of a lot. I just was so blinded by the mistakes, i couldnt see the magic or the beauty. same thing i used to do in high school when i had one freakin pimple on my face and thought my life was over. it looked HUGE, but when i put it into perspective, it was such a small part of me..yet controlling so much of who i allowe myself to be. and this was doing the same thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;this year i fucking &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;produced and released my first album completely independently and made it into the top 100 on the rock itunes charts, developed a clothing line at the same time, started a magazine that is going stronger than ever, did two seasons of a reality show on my terms, played lots of shows around the country and the world with the help of an incredible and devoted following of rebels and lovers who are also a HUGE success and reason to celebrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and of course, i &lt;span&gt;didnt&lt;/span&gt; do it alone. i had the help of an amazing team. a team that continues to amaze me with their dedication and perseverance. And so im blasting into the new year. sailed blazing through the sea of possibility. the road behind me smothered forever by a tidal wave of molten lava called NO TURNING BACK. so i look forward. i cant wait to do it all over again with all this juicy experience behind me..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; the cork has been popped. its time to celebrate! pass around the bubbly we’re gonna make it just fine!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in conclusion:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;you may notice some shifts in me. &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; been clearing out the old and making room for the new. i gutted my &lt;span&gt;youtube&lt;/span&gt; channel…including my music video, whiskey in churches. I know &lt;span&gt;alot&lt;/span&gt; of you love it, and i still of course love it as well. its my first music video! but i needed to do it for my own reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; that video was fun, but as i start over and rise from the ashes and i need to let some of the past go. i am ready for the next chapter and its time to make like madonna and reinvent myself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now those of you who found me through that video and fear this change as some sort of sign that who i will someone you might not like, &lt;span&gt;dont&lt;/span&gt; worry. i will always be devoted to you. this last year will be our special intimate time. lots and lots of new people will be finding out about me very soon, but you and I will always have this year as our own. it was my magical little fishbowl from which to experience what is REALLY involved in this career. i learned what it is like to have fans, to have a public eye watching and giving opinions..I learned about the harsh reality of record labels, of the joy in meeting people that just love me and my music so much. i learned how to properly execute a record release through the successes and failures of THE FOOL, how to focus time and energy around a campaign to get the most bang for my buck..how to actually produce my own music (YES, still learning but loving every minute of it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and also got to distinguish exactly what is the art i am sharing..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; stripped away my costumes. i want my music to tell the story..and i &lt;span&gt;dont&lt;/span&gt; want anything to distract from that dream that i am weaving with my songs. part of me used the gimmicks of all the costumes to hide insecurities about being a good enough performer. So &lt;span&gt;ive&lt;/span&gt; decided to strip all that away and really hone in exclusively on my craft. the epic costumes will be back. but for now this is important for my development as an artist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;so as you see these changes, i want you to know its not me abandoning my past, or selling out, its really me evolving as an artist and finding the essence of what i am doing here. i am a story teller. and i will be telling my stories in many, many ways for a long time..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and the next one is coming sooner than you may think…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;so thank you for sitting through this ramble of a blog post. you all are very special to me and i hope you will follow me into the future…bottle of champagne in tow…the ivory towers waiting in the distance..driving you to never give up..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;champagne or suicide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When i started pursuing music last year i was well aware of the turmoil the industry had gone through. we all know what has taken place over the past ten years with the introduction of the digital music era and I knew that in order to be successful in this modern age of music i would have to offer more than just music. because music is free. the game has changed. Music was once defined by the package. but now the package is irrelevant to the listening experience. And what is left after the package is obsolete is something amorphous, something intangible that one doesnt really have to pay for. like air or water. So i made my merchandise and my t-shirts and started developing my new clothing line..and all that is fine and dandy, and definitely subsidies my business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but after all is said and done i am here for the music. to tell my stories with a song and hopefully connect with folks on a personal and emotional level that makes a difference for them. As much as i work with other mediums, in the end i am most proud of the songs i write and how they touch people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where my gratitude comes in. Because knowing that music is free means that every time one of you purchases one of my tracks what you are really saying is that you believe in me. that you are willing to spend that extra dollar to show your pledge even when you dont have to. And i am so thankful that you do. because i know you dont have to. i know you could easily rip the song from the bandcamp website, or have one of your friends email you the track, or any number of other ways that music is passed back and forth. believe me i do it all the time. its just a part of our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but YOU buy it.  this proverbial donation towards my career is a gift far beyond the dollar amount. On rare occasions i buy the music of independent artists simply because i want to show them my support. and i know that each time you purchase a song, that is what you are doing. you dont have to. but you do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so thank you. for buying my music. i sometimes cant believe i am actually doing this business of music after so many years of being afraid to take it on. but i am. and You make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And just to be clear, i dont resent people that get my music for free. go for it! pass it around! i want lots and lots of people to hear me and if sending someone a downloaded track via email or burning someone a cd is going to introduce a new fan to my music then by all means share it. I am a product of the modern world and have a very clear awareness of this freedom of music (and the need for a new artist to share their music freely as a promotional tactic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but when and if you do buy it, know that i am deeply and forever grateful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look back on what i’ve accomplished with my fans and i am just amazed. Daylight breaks was the first fan-funded and produced video i ever did, and it is now in the running to be one of logo’s top ten videos of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;( VOTE FOR IT HERE. AGAIN AND AGAIN: &lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/ac1UFN"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/ac1UFN"&gt;http://bit.ly/ac1UFN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;that is incredible! it is along side videos from artists who have huge industry support and millions of fans, and yet there it sits, side by side.  a proud symbol that i can pave my own way and create a career without the huge capital injection of a major label. So thank you. for every song you have downloaded, for every donation to my various projects over the past year, and for the continuing support in all its forms. music is free. and that makes each song you buy ever so much more meaningful. i dont take that for granted and i never will. thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1467258681</link><guid>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1467258681</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2010 19:45:17 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>TEXAS HOSPITALITY </title><description>&lt;p&gt;this weekend I flew to Galveston, Texas to perform at their annual pride festival. with no expectations, I found myself among the sweetest, most fun-loving community of people EVER! They were so excited to have me there and the whole experience was so freaking enjoyable. the event producers started it off right with an AMAZING seafood dinner on friday night, followed by a dynamic duo chauffeur team who drove me around in one of their MANY classic Rolls-Royce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a title="Untitled by cassidiesmusic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/89416310@N00/5124683850/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1388/5124683850_6e5da6a40b.jpg" width="500" height="375"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;yes! the event was well attended and so much fun! alot of fans were there which was awesome! this is my Dallas street team who drove 6 hours to see me! I was floored by their dedication. they were so cool! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a title="photo-4 by cassidiesmusic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/89416310@N00/5124090733/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/5124090733_4e1a1d7534.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo-4"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; the Houston street team was so cool as well! led by my houston captain at arms, Courtney, they came in and set up and were just so professional and effective. they handled all the merch and one them, shira, even jumped in to be my stage hand.&lt;br/&gt;I felt so supported and in good hands all around.  the show was something new for me. I wore jeans. yes jeans. I’ve been having some realizations recently about developing my stage presence and what I realized is that it is time to really hone in on the essence of what I  doing. the ballgowns and the bodypaint and the leather coattails and the underwear are all fun but as an exercise I decided to leave all that behind and just focus on the songs and let the stories will stand on their own. this proved to be a really effective way to get to the root of what I’m doing. o had so much up there and connecting with all the fans in the audience. I may wear a ballgown or bodypaint again, but for now I am loving the simplicity of this presentation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a title="Picture 5 by cassidiesmusic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/89416310@N00/5124713996/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1077/5124713996_69d567fb63.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="Picture 5"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;after the show the real fun began. the party went until 2am and I just had a blast dancing with all the fans and, um, experiencing the local culture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I gave these two a private chest signing backstage: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Untitled by cassidiesmusic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/89416310@N00/5124680612/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/5124680612_85eaa8f321.jpg" width="375" height="500"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and that’s enough about that..hehe..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another highlight was that I finally got to meet my pal @joeyguerra from the houston chronicle!  hes written a few articles about me starting last year and we have stayed in touch via twitter and such and it was great to finally meet him! he did an amazing job as the entertainment organizer for this event and it was a complete success!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;congrats joey!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;so in conclusion,  and too cleverly tie this final paragraph into my title, I will reiterate that the hospitality of this town was just amazing!! &lt;/span&gt;I kept getting shot after shot handed to me! almost as if people were TRYING to get me drunk. why ever would they do that? well, anyways, things got a little blurry at that point..but I did wake up in my OWN hotel room without TOO much of a hang over and all my possessions and limbs intact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;which is surprising after i woke up to THIS picture on facebook: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a title="photo-3 by cassidiesmusic, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/89416310@N00/5124697308/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1259/5124697308_1d5b405d48.jpg" width="500" height="394" alt="photo-3"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;guess it must have been fun!&lt;br/&gt;SO i can safely say I love Texas and cannot wait to go back for another show with my awesome fans there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here is a few i got to share the camera with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first album THE FOOL was a very personal introspection. I’ve had a huge desire to make a difference in the world as long as I can remember, but at some point I realized that in order to be the hero i envisioned myself to be, i would first need to go inward and uncover all the things that were holding me back and keeping me from really being that hero i saw inside. I have spent a long time doing just that and THE FOOL tells that story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is always more to discover about one’s self, but i have come to the place where i am ready to take that personal journey and let it fuel a broader, more global one. There is so much work that needs to be done in the world and I feel i am finally ready to be a part of that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month ago i was playing with my band, jamming on some chords and making up lyrics as we went along and all of a sudden something came over me. These words started pouring out that i was not really controlling. We happened to be recording this moment, which i am forever grateful for. later i went back and transcribed what it was that i had been saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This song, Vagabonds to the Marching Troupes, is the result. I changed very little from that first magical moment of inspiration and upon later inspection was blown away by the message and feeling of this. It reminded me of a part of myself i had tucked away for a very long time. A time when i was so committed to this planet i lived in a tree in Oregon for a month in the dead of winter as an activist in a tree-sit to protect old-growth forests from destruction. That young boy’s fierce determination, unfortunately, was tainted by a deep shame and massive unfamiliarity with himself. But now, many years later, i am ready to take on the world with that same determination, and a much larger sense of self. The personal work i have done has given me the power and strength to take this global work much farther than was possible in my early years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO i am proud to present to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagabonds to the Marching troupes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;object data="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=94743801/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//" type="text/html" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="400" height="100"&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This song is a call to action. The global struggle for the environment and the hardship people face on this planet are NOT independent of one another. The gay suicides of this nation and the Oppression of third world democracies by multinational corporations and the slow and deafening obliteration natural life on this planet is all the same fight.  There is a sickness here. We all share it. We all live it. And we all have a duty to overcome it. its not a fight that will be won with violence, and i certainly dont have the answers as to what it will take to win, but, for me, its time to take that fools leap off the cliff and trust that all the tools we have to win this interconnected struggle for survival as a species are right in front of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“silently these times they change, the cross we bear will rearrange…its far away, but ever closer still”&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1369109030</link><guid>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1369109030</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2010 15:56:39 -0700</pubDate><category>cassidy haley</category><category>vagabonds to the marching troupes</category></item><item><title>stereo to mono and back again...</title><description>&lt;p&gt;i want to share with you my recent breakthrough. it is slightly embarrassing, but i think it illustrates a poignant aspect of life that is always good to remember so i will allow my pride to suffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in no way an expert in electronic music, but i have been producing electronic elements for my music for quite a few years. i consider myself well versed in the programs i use and pride myself on my skills. i always work with a producer for “official” tracks, but usually do my live stuff (for performing to, etc) myself. However, for quite some time ive been dealing with a feeling that my final tracks just sound muddy and a bit lost. this drives me crazy because when i mix the track it sounds awesome but as soon as i bounce it down (meaning take the 30 or so tracks to the song and make them one file, like you find in itunes) everything just gets lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this has frustrated me to no end and ive tried everything to figure out what is wrong. well the other day i discovered something. as well versed as i am in ableton live, there is a little button in the settings that says “convert to mono” i look at it everytime i bounce down a track, and yet somehow i never noticed or it never registered that it was selected. this means that all the lovely panning (panning is when some sounds come out of the left or right, at different levels, to add clarity to a track) was lost EVERY time i bounced down something. i created all sorts of systems to compensate for this during my period of ignorance. i would bounce down tracks 5 times listening intently to each part, trying to find what wasnt working, never realizing that one, small setting was creating a HUGE crutch to the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well the other day i figured it out. Ive been focusing on clarity of mind recently and i guess its working, because all of a sudden i looked down at that little settings bar and BAM. there it was. “convert to mono-ON”. i was shocked. i felt foolish. and i was also so extremely elated to have found the answer to this epic saga of frustration. Suddenly, with that little button un-selected, the tracks i bounce down sound EXACTLY like what i work with in the program. this occurs like a miracle to me. its a revelation! like 100 tons have been lifted! all due to one small blindspot that was right in front of me the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sharing this story because this is the perfect little analogy for so much more in my life, and perhaps yours.  we all have these blindspots that slow us down. the struggles that, when we discover them, make us feel so foolish for not seeing it sooner.  But you know what? the months and months i was struggling to figure out what was wrong, pouring over each aspect of the software, I learned so fucking much. i may not have discovered the answer that way, but the lessons for the software as a whole have left me with a new level of competence and skill that i did not have before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So let my story be your story. breath a sigh of relief my friends. the answer will come the moment it is supposed too and not a minute before. the only tragedy would be to NOT take all the lessons you can from each situation along the way. SO trust. and relax into the process. you WILL figure it out.  sometimes all it takes is one small shift in perception ( and the press of one small button) and BAM, your whole world is altered forever. Now im gonna go make the sickest track ive ever made and perform it all over the fucking world. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1303948948</link><guid>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1303948948</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2010 21:49:27 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>you are amazing. i love you so much, and you really inspire me. thanks for being so incredibly talented and awesome &lt;br /&gt;&#13;

This habit has served me well up until this point. but what this string of physical ailments has shown me is that i cant force this path, no matter how much i push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i didnt share this before, but a week ago i threw out my back as well. in the interest of not showing weakness i chose not to tweet about it…but yes, my friends, its true. as if the flu and a sprained ankle weren’t enough, i also hurt my back. ive realized that what ive been trying to do is beat the system (the “system” being of course the universal law of life. of fate. the perfectly geometric plan that exists in every fiber of all of us and everything on this planet…) but the system is perfect and cannot be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I sacrifice sleep and rest, i wind up sick. i sacrifice community i sink into loneliness. i sacrifice occasional silence and loose my voice.  each new trick i try just thrusts me right back to the beginning. im trying to force an outcome that cannot be forced and ive sacrificing the journey for the perceived destination. depriving myself of the pure enjoyment and excitement of being alive. only god knows what is planned for me. and I trust that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the universe has never let me down before. everything has led me to this perfect moment and call me a hippie and feed me a ganja cookie but i trust this life! i trust the plan! I know that what is in store is perfect.. because to believe otherwise would be to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if the mistakes I’ve made and the failures I’ve experienced  were not the perfect things for me to experience well than I’ve already lost it all. and I know its a choice. I know life is what i make of it..merrily, merrily and so forth down the stream…so why not make it perfect? a sprained ankle becomes the perfect self-imposed meditation. and the flu becomes the necessary purging of fear and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my infantile ideas of what is possible and what i am capable of..but I know that god is vastly more equipt to move these chess pieces around until my destiny is revealed. and thats just how i want to look at this life. it satisfies me. and so…having been given this amazing and wonderful gift from god in the form of a sprained ankle, the flu, and a hurt back, i step forth into the world. refreshed and ready to accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1190143694</link><guid>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/1190143694</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2010 00:09:00 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>Vancouver day 2/3</title><description>&lt;p&gt;God i love this city!!! people are chill, happy and friendly. met some great folks this weekend. saturday was spent indulging in the super new high-tech gym they have, running around looking for a hoop skirt to complete my outfit for my shows, and then heading to J-lounge for performance #2. J-lounge was a beautiful swanky lounge in the heart of gayville…I performed with this great San Fran band called “fans of Jimmy Century” &lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/fansofjimmycentury"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/fan"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/fan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/fansofjimmycentury"&gt;&lt;span class="word_break"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sofjimmycentury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; who blew me away with their show. they were great fun. My team continued their AWESOMENESS with handling merch and helping me run around all day and i met another of my street team, Shawn Nielsen, who has been working his butt off up here with Janet and the rest. He was a charming little fellow wearing a feather boa and the brightest smile. it was a fun fun night! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;got a decent amount of sleep and awoke to cloudy skies. luckily my faithful interwebs informed me that it would indeed clear up as it does in this lovely city so i bravely left the hotel in an outfit more fitting of the tropics than this coastal fog. and as always the interwebs did not let me down. clear skies were the backdrop for this beautiful festival. right on the water and a great stage and crowd and sound system..HUGE success! at this point my little team of McCullochs were pretty much my favorite people on the planet. They ran the merch booth ALL DAY in the sun and pimped me out to everyone. they even sold a number of CD’s before i even went on stage! Fans of Jimmy century were performing on sunday as well so we got to hang out for a bit and discuss future collaborations (YES TO NETWORKING!) that night i frolicked around w/ them for a bit and, having completed all my shows for the weekend, allowed myself to, ahem, let loose at ye’ ol nightclubs de la gay. great time, great folks. I WILL BE BACK. Vancouver !leave you a substantial part of my heart…&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/905381531</link><guid>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/905381531</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2010 18:21:03 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>Photo</title><description>&lt;img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6lgcbhuVa1qcihzro1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; photo by Janet McCulloch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6lgcbhuVa1qcihzro2_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Photo by Janet McCulloch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src="http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6lgcbhuVa1qcihzro3_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; photo by janet McCulloch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6lgcbhuVa1qcihzro4_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; photo by Jesse Jenner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </description><link>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/901624261</link><guid>http://cassidyhaley.tumblr.com/post/901624261</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2010 22:42:47 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>Vancouver DAY 1</title><description>&lt;p&gt;wow! yesterday was awesome. arrived to Vancouver with a less then pleasant customs experience which left me traumatized and feeling like a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i got disapproving eyes about a fare-evasion arrest when i was 17. he asked me if i had ever been arrested and i said “not in my adult life” and he squinted all evil like and i said “ok maybe as a minor but does that even count?” and he said “well i know about it anyways. so…” and i said “i think it was for smoking pot or something” and he said “actually it was a subway fare evasion” and i quickly put my foot in my mouth. luckily he let me through without strip-searching me..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;although..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*PAUSE* he was kind of cute and that could have been fun.. but he may have found the 16 pairs of gloves and 10 sidebags i was sneaking in to sell at the shows..which would have sucked but he didnt so that was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyways, once that harrowing experience was over i walked out of the airport (quite shaken and paranoid) to a smiling woman waiting for me at the airport. That would be Janet( or @redhairedwitch on twitter), who incredibly set up this entire weekend of shows in Vancouver (hear that street team? you can do it too and ill hang out with you all weekend!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as we were leaving the airport I got stopped by a fan who wanted to take a picture with me and said she had read my grandaddy’s book. (my grandpa is a quite famous therapist who wrote many books on the subject of family therapy. I always name drop when i meet therapists and they are impressed. ya that would be JAY HALEY. bask in the glory people. bask. ) I was half blind and still traumatized by customs but how could i turn her down? i had never been recognized in another country before, so of course i obliged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so Janet and I drove into vancouver. meeting fans in this context is a little like a blind date, you never know what you are going to get..luckily we hit it off right away! She immediately took me to a raw food place for lunch (BIG POINTS) at some small hippie joint that made me feel right at home. then she birthed two AWESOME daughters who were really cool and showed up (MORE BIG POINTS!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;daughter #1 was Sheleigh who is a super cute 19 yr old with great style and a quirky love for tarot (bonded over THE FOOL reference) and spends her time doing palm reading (YES!) and Justine is her brainy older sister who is studying grassland ecology, which is pretty fricking cool and I realized how glad i am that SOMEONE was studying grassland ecology because i dont know a thing about it and it just seems like a really good thing that someone on this planet knows whats up with the grasslands. so i give her big props.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point i breathed a sigh of relief at having a great little crew around me. i was pretty dead tired after staying up all night finishing the beats and a some costume additions and only had about an hour to settle in before sound check..but all went on without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My little team was super on point with helping me set props, communicate with the sound guy, and promote to the viewers after the show. and get this people, in Vancouver, they ACTUALLY DANCE. I was shocked. in LA everybody stands there with their arms folded analyzing the show (myself included) especially when you have some strange guy in body paint and gold dusted ears up there singing folks songs set to dance beats about sexual depravity. but here in Vancouver, they were DANCING!!!!  not only were they dancing, but they were SINGING ALONG. these people had never heard my music and yet here they were singing along to DYING TO LIVE. crazy!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;needless to say i love this city. its super clean, progressive and friendly. The coolest part is that i get to do it all over again tonight at J-lounge and for a third time tomorrow at the actual pride parade.  ill be sure to include you guys in the process so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-over and out..&lt;/p&gt;
