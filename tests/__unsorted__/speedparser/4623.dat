		<title>Embracing the F-word</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve noticed that many management/business blog posts and articles I&#8217;ve read recently have focused on &#8216;the F word&#8217;&#8230;. failure. It seems that failure (or at least talking/writing about failure) is &#8216;in&#8217;. The entire April 2011 issue of the Harvard Business Review was devoted to the topic of failure and The Economist is talking about &#8216;the ...]]></description>

		<title>Why I don&#8217;t believe in work-life balance (Part 2)</title>
		<description><![CDATA[In part 1 of my post on the topic of ‘work-life balance’ I shared my thoughts about why I don’t particularly like the term and suggested that paying attention to the range of aspects that make up your ‘life well-being’ (your emotional/mental health, physical health, financial health etc) was a better approach than simply trying ...]]></description>

		<title>On being wrong</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Being right, and the idea/feeling of being so convinced of your own &#8216;rightness&#8217; (or the frustration in dealing with others&#8217; unwavering belief in their own &#8216;rightness&#8217; and your associated &#8216;wrongness&#8217;) is something I&#8217;ve been thinking/discussing quite a bit lately, so I very much enjoyed Kathryn Schulz&#8217;s PopTech Talk on Being Wrong&#8230; I like her key ...]]></description>

		<title>I wish I&#8217;d been more nervous</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m not a super-confident person, so more nerves is something I can probably do without&#8230; but today was one of the rare moments when I actually wish I&#8217;d been more nervous. I&#8217;m currently organising and participating in a &#8216;trainer skills&#8217; development program. Basically a four-day training course on how to be a better trainer/presenter. This ...]]></description>

		<title>My favourite iPhone apps</title>
		<description><![CDATA[After much resistance and deliberation, my good friend Emily has decided to join the dark side and get an iPhone. While I am somewhat ashamed to admit just how fused I have become to my iPhone in the 18 months of so that I&#8217;ve had it, I have been meaning to do a little post ...]]></description>

		<title>Why I don&#8217;t believe in work-life balance (Part 1)</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve never really liked the term ‘work-life balance’. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I’ve never really understood what it means. It’s something that everyone seems to talk about, so I feel like I should know what it is. But I’ve never &#8216;got&#8217; it. In any case, whatever it is, I’m pretty sure that I don’t have it. ...]]></description>

		<title>A week of food</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I had a disappointing weigh-in at our personal training session this morning. Not happy with myself at all. Had a great result the week before and clearly got a little complacent (that Baileys and scorched almond ice-cream I had in Braidwood was delicious, but clearly not the best idea!). So, in an effort to turn ...]]></description>
