Less than a fortnight later he crashed his car outside his Florida home and from this what was to unfold in his personal life was to temporarily put a stop to his competitive golfing career.Following on from Tiger’s crash revelations started unfolding that he had had many an affair with many a beautiful lady. He claimed that these weren’t just sleazy affairs but that he had a ‘problem’ and needed help for his infidelity issues. Following the storm of publicity about his personal conduct at the end of last year, Woods made his first public appearance in February to apologize for his actions.The golf child prodigy who was once named the world number one and was said to rule the sport of golf for years to come, since the revelations, has not won a major or single PGA tournament. With the sacking of former stroke coaches and caddies, could this be something to do with it? Maybe he should get himself a <a href="http://www.rangefindersave.com/">rangefinder</a>. Or since the death of his father which affected him and his golf form badly, has he never recovered? Was his father the real inspiration behind the once great Tiger Woods? So, is the great Tiger Woods ever going to regain his perfect golf form and genius golfing attitude, or has he lost the passion and fight for the great game due to his personal issues and misfortunes. Is he slowly slipping into mid-table golfing obscurity?]]></description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2010 12:59:26 +0000</pubDate> </item> <item> <title><![CDATA[The best and worst shots of my golfing day!]]></title> <link>http://www.rangefindersave.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-shots-of-my-golfing-day/</link> <description><![CDATA[<strong>Hole one</strong> What a drive, I got my <a href="http://www.rangefindersave.com">rangefinder</a> out and I’ve got 120 yards left, so I pitch on to the green, ime putting for birdie and I hole the putt. Feeling good today, however in golf what begins well doesn’t necessarily always end well!<strong>Hole Five</strong>This hole was what I personally describe as ‘topping the ball on my drive’ in order for my ball to end up 30 yards from where I am standing. Which means that by the time my ball has landed there really is no point in me getting my rangefinder out as I still have quite a considerable way to go.<strong>Hole 7</strong>I appear to be getting worse as the holes go on. On hole seven, firstly I draw into the rough, I would attempt to get my rangefinder out, however, I will have to find my ball first.<strong>Hole 9</strong>Standard bogey on this hole, have just discovered putting is not my strong point. Looking at the club house thinking is it worth another painful nine holes, do I quit now, of course not because i am always chasing that perfect hole.<strong>Hole 11</strong>Would you believe it, my luck is finally on the up, par three, T shot four foot from the pin, holed for a birdie.<strong>Hole 13</strong>My luck is definitely running back out again, in the rough once more, so that will be two lost balls for me today, great. <strong>Hole 16</strong>I just want to give up and go home!<strong>Hole 18</strong>Thank god that is over. Think I definitely need more practice in the driving range and less gob as I seem to have bigged myself up to something that I definitely can’t deliver today. Shall I blame the slightly wet weather, my clubs or the ball?]]></description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2010 12:57:07 +0000</pubDate> </item> <item> <title><![CDATA[Drive record goes unbeaten!]]></title> <link>http://www.rangefindersave.com/blog/drive-record-goes-unbeaten/</link> <description><![CDATA[The record for the longest drive was set 35 years ago in 1974 with a wooden club. However, with all of the technology that is around nowadays, the different clubs and irons and of course the sheer skill of many of today’s golfers the question has to be asked as to why this record hasn’t been beaten?This mighty record was set on 25 September 1974 by a 64-year-old man called Mike Austin. Legend has it that Austin is drove a golf ball 515 yards from the tee. This record does not stand in the Guinness World records, however, it was witnessed by former PGA golfing champion Chandler Harper, some course officials from the Las Vegas Golf Course and the rest of the four ball grouping.Buy why hasn’t this record been beaten?There is so much advanced technology in golf nowadays, from <a href="http://www.rangefindersave.com/">golf rangefinders</a> , to golf stroke simulators; to basic practice nets and putting mats for your own home, they all aim in some way to improve your golfing game.Not only is the technology a lot more advanced than it was in 1974 but so are the clubs, balls and stroke techniques available. From golf irons and drivers, to putters and wedges, there really are so many different clubs around in order to create a more accurate, precise form of finding the hole on the golf course. And not only are the golf clubs more advanced in style, but they are also different in material, surely a metal club would have more power and speed to drive a golf ball than a wooden club would? Balls have also advanced in style over the years in terms of power, distance, spin and weight. So again, in this advanced era of the golfing game, the question remains; why hasn’t the record for the longest drive been beaten?]]></description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2010 12:52:45 +0000</pubDate> </item> <item> <title><![CDATA[Range Finders legal in Golf Tournaments]]></title> <link>http://www.rangefindersave.com/blog/range-finders-legal-in-golf-tournaments/</link> <description><![CDATA[<strong>Now you can legally use a Golf Range Finder in all but the very top Golf Tournaments!</strong><br/>The difference between one club can mean as much as 20-40 yards off target, why risk a whole tournament on a guess?<br/><br/>Choosing the right club for the right situation really matters especially when there are water hazards and blocking bunkers.<br/><br/>Some of our range finders feature “pin seeker technology” which spots a flag from a distance and gives you an exact distance towards it. Cheaper range finders use laser technology to calculate distances to the ground below the flag but these still give a very accurate picture of how far you should shoot with a ±1 yard accuracy.<br/><br/>Remember that if you're in a tournament you may wish to leave the range finder in your bag on the 1st and 18th hole as some people may get frustrated that you have a slight advantage over them. The highest powers in Golf have deemed range finders as tournament play friendly and any expert should be able to back this fact up, if in doubt ask your tournament director or club house.<br/><br/>Whether you're in tournament play or just practicing you should record down which club worked best for which distance to the pin. This constant refinement of your game will result in better decisions when choosing the perfect club number.]]></description> <pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2010 14:24:06 +0000</pubDate> </item> </channel></rss>
