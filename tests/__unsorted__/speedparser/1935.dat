title="Angry Politics in Perspective" href="http://longgame.org/2010/04/angry-politics-in-perspective/" target="_blank">social slope</a> I’m on. Another problem is simply discerning the contours of my own life. If I can&#8217;t hack <em>that</em>, then what business do I have wondering about all this long now stuff?</p><p>Oh, that’s right. It’s <em>fun</em>. I forget sometimes, but that trump card is always taped to my wrist.</p><p>Personal ignorance notwithstanding, part of constructing a narrative from the noise of daily life involves some minor mythmaking. I&#8217;m always game for that.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">Not true. No. Sorta. Yes. A little. Except for the &#39;boring&#39; part.</p></div><p>My latest myth includes a few poignant subplots, but centers around my desire to improve my career. This is driven, at least partially, by <a
title="We Are the 99 Percent" href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">the simply wonderful state of the economy</a>.</p><p>I have a fine job, health insurance, and a steady income, but I still feel the breath of the creditors violating my personal space. We&#8217;re buried in debt and stressed out by money, but that only makes us fortunate Americans. It seems silly to bitch. But, at least it’s resulted in an abnormal amount of motivation in a professional sense.</p><h3>Aside</h3><p>As if that didn&#8217;t function as a lame excuse for writing less, did i mention that I&#8217;ve hit the publish button on this damn blog <strong>300 times</strong> now? It&#8217;s fitting that it follows a period of relative silence. I don&#8217;t schedule these ironies, but they sure walk straight into frame with uncanny timing.</p><p>Why the silence? Over the past few months, I&#8217;ve been putting another layer of bondo on the TransAm. Gonna grow a moustache. Maybe a rockin&#8217; tat. Got a new jacket picked out. It’s pretty sweet. Maybe I&#8217;ll grow a ponytail&#8230;</p><p>Just kidding. Though it&#8217;s a glib way to dismiss my current mindset, let me cut the small morsel of the &#8216;sad&#8217; with the wider reality. That’s all thanks to my wife’s subtle tweaking. She’s a damned fine engineer, by the way. She&#8217;s got a light touch. She&#8217;s about accentuating what&#8217;s already there. As a result, I&#8217;m not having a midlife crisis. It&#8217;s more of a midlife makeover.</p><p>It takes talent, grace, and no small amount of patience to see the potential within me and subtly prod me toward mental, physical, and spiritual health. There&#8217;s no <em>cure</em> for me (it&#8217;s a managed condition, after all), but the results are still remarkable. How I got from chubby, unrepentant, single loser to healthy, confident, successful family man is a mystery. It&#8217;s <a
title="So slow, I didn’t see it coming" href="http://longgame.org/2011/09/so-slow-i-didnt-see-it-coming/" target="_blank">another one of those things</a> that happened too slowly to note.</p><p>What I didn’t expect was to <em>like</em> it quite so much. I figured on just <em>tolerating</em> it. I have always hated getting dirty or muddy. Going waaaaay back. Now we do things <a

title="The Plus Button I Want" href="http://longgame.org/2011/07/the-plus-button-i-want/" target="_blank">has me thinking more</a> about this online stuff. How can I be more efficient? Lots of answers present themselves, but these few bobbed to the top: No alternate blogs. No posterous. Nothing. If it&#8217;s an offhand comment, it goes on a wall. Everything else goes here.</p><p>Why shouldn&#8217;t it? I mean, who the hell has &#8216;work blogs&#8217; anymore? The key, for us newbies, is that blogs aren&#8217;t about <em>one thing</em>. There about a <em>person&#8217;s</em> many things. Anyway, my work blog is history following the excise and re-appropriation some of the good stuff.</p><p>This means you can expect some more visualization and jobhacking stuff here. I still love long term thinking, geopolitics, and that <em>nature of the cosmos</em> stuff, but I love sweet pens, too.</p><p>At this nice, big, arbitrary round number, it&#8217;s important to take a moment to thank all the lurkers. I really appreciate the quiet dedication you&#8217;ve placed into reading the first few paragraphs of my words before getting distracted by a moth. I will work hard to get that up to three paragraphs. To those of you who have actually <em>commented?</em>&#8230; well, I just <strong>love</strong> you people.</p><p><a
title="The best blog out there." href="http://boingboing.net" target="_blank">BoingBoing</a>, and a million other awesome writers, are the reason every one of you should skim and/or avoid me. But, they’re also constant inspiration to keep writing in a dark cave. I’m a supervillian. Slowly waiting; biding my time; getting better; wringing my hands.</p><p>Damn, it is so fun to wring my hands. Try it.</p><div

I raise an eyebrow, think <em>huh</em>, and continue on my merry way. From lower back pain, to the uncontrollable spasms and extreme fatigue,  I somehow blind myself to the howling gang of angry monkeys digging claws into my shoulders. A vertebrate has to snap before I get a clue.</p><p>Sometimes, though, after exhausting all possible nothings, I figure a few things out.</p><h3>Meander with me for a second.</h3><p>During the mid 90&#8242;s, two of my friends from childhood left our hometown to follow me to Minneapolis, where we shared a downtown apartment. For myself and one of my friends, it was the first time we&#8217;d lived in a city. Not so for the third friend, Rich.</p><p>He&#8217;d previously lived on campus at an art school in Portland, Maine. He was (and is) an artist in as many ways as I can think. He&#8217;d pick up a drum, a guitar, a brush, a pencil, a bunch of junk, you name it, and create something special with them. I always envied that.</p><p>One day during the hot Minneapolis summer, while sitting around the apartment, he grabbed a pad and sketched a picture of me. It was quick and cartoony, but definitely <em>me</em>. After he finished drawing me, he slowly and very carefully drew a series of lines behind me. It was the outline of a square box. <em>Because Matt&#8217;s always in a room</em>.</p><p>It&#8217;s true. And painful. I&#8217;ve taken steps to be less <em>roomy</em>, but it&#8217;s still a succinct analysis. Now that I have a family, I&#8217;m trying to change that. There&#8217;s a lot more non-room activity than there ever was before. I hike and walk. But what caused me to be pushed into rooms was set into motion by circumstance.</p><p>When I was a kid, my allergies were merciless, and chiefly focused on anything that grows. If it had leaves, I was allergic to it. Also hay, pollen, and anything with fur. Every attempt to spend time in the woods was punctuated by constant hacking, nose-blowing, and sneezing. Even if I <em>did</em> manage to make it into the forest, mosquitos would completely ignore my friends and have a party with me. So much for the outside.</p><p>Our family tried to have a pet, too. I might have had fun walking a dog, but my father&#8217;s <em>even worse</em> allergy to animals was so acute that one week with a pet hamster nearly caused him to asphyxiate in bed.</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t the boy in the bubble, or anything. I did play outside, but rarely in the woods. But those circumstances are factors draw a clear, clean line to the present.</p><h3>Now follow me back.</h3><div

class="wp-caption-text">And so am I.</p></div><p>The room became my comfort zone, so the computer became my tool of choice. Over the years, computers changed and quickly grew out of their status as the latest glorified HAM radio to become chiefly a communication tool.</p><p>A shit-ton of media is at my fingertips.</p><p>I can play games, chat with friends, make plans with other friends, read newsfeeds, catch up with family, get irritated at news, get more irritated at <em>other</em> news, watch videos I can&#8217;t unwatch, and watch the most random stuff I never would have known existed back when I was a kid. Basically, I have collapsed in exhaustion from a day of over-stimulation - too much time with too many glowing rectangles showing too many things.</p><p>It happened <em>so slowly</em>. But here I am, now coping with anxieties that, while not caused by <em>the room</em>, is surely exasperated by it. Now I&#8217;m adjusting my habits. I&#8217;ve pruned the newsfeeds, weeded out the controversial political stuff (and not just stuff I find agreement with), blocked the ads, and ignored every possible fluffy/irritating social network source that I can. I must.</p><p>When the gears in your head move quickly, the internet has a way of accelerating them to speeds that are red-hot.</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m reading too much into all this. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time. I just know that the road from <em>back then</em> to <em>right now</em> sneaked up on me with a fierceness that I&#8217;m only appreciating now. The things I carry with me, the traits I identify as so much <em>me</em> have origins that live in my past. I don&#8217;t see most of them; this is just a sliver of a single thing I happened to catch sight of.</p><p>My biology led to the room led to the computer led to media saturation and overstimulation. It&#8217;s not for nothing that we&#8217;re reading so much about taking control. I think I understand now, more than ever, that we really do <em>surf</em> the internet, but most of us don&#8217;t know how to swim. We click to stay ahead, afraid to fall in, getting anxious with each time around.</p><p>Anyway, I&#8217;d like to ditch a few of those monkeys the next time I make it to shore. My back&#8217;s really tired and it&#8217;s hard to navigate the waves with a tower of screeching simians.</p><div

class="alignright size-full wp-image-13365" title="luck-chinese" src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/luck-chinese.gif" alt="" width="148" height="140" />A recurring theme is the notion that we play this game with <a
title="The choices we don’t have" href="http://longgame.org/2010/03/the-choices-we-dont-have/" target="_blank">loaded dice</a>. A bunch of cultural and material benefits constitute those <em>bootstraps</em> we boast about. I suspect that our sense of worth <em>and</em> our sense of victimhood is nourished by what we don&#8217;t know about luck.</span></h3><p>Of course, there&#8217;s agency. I have to Believe it. Free will is a conceit, though I admit I hold it loosely. The question then becomes: <em>How</em> <em>much</em> of it do we have?</p><p>Andrew Boardman shared a <em><a
title="Helpful tips for navigating the inane situations that comprise life." href="http://basicinstructions.net/" target="_blank">Basic Instructions</a> </em>that made me smile<em>. </em>It might help you make some sense of things the next time you talk to a self-made man. The last panel does a better job of expressing the feelings that orbit <em>luck</em> than anything I&#8217;ve written. <a
title="Seriously. Read it." href="http://basicinstructions.net/basic-instructions/2011/8/14/how-to-talk-to-someone-whos-lucky.html" target="_blank">Go read it</a>. <img

Maybe it will inform our social and political life in a way that would seem positively alien to us now.</p><p>Maybe, a few hundred years from now, our distant progeny will marvel at our ignorance. Maybe they&#8217;ll stand in amazement of the rhetorical gymnastics we employ to justify an unfair order. And they&#8217;ll think that of all the possible orders, because all of them lack what is, for them, settled science.</p><p>Far into the future, what if our distant progeny pities the whole lot of us? Our distant past, our near-future visitors, and the future further than that. Our progeny from that far future will draw a line under the first 30,000 years of civilization, and name it <em>The Stupid Ages</em>. It will be 10% ironic, because they&#8217;ll know that <em>that </em>period led to the <em>now</em> they enjoy. It&#8217;s just, well, embarrassing.</p><p>It sucks to live in a transitional time. It sucks harder to know that this transition&#8217;s will probably take at least the next few thousand years.</p><p><span

No amount of protest seems to work.

title="A fascinating little strip about the circle of life." href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2331#comic" target="_blank">a comic</a></strong> by <a
title="This is a must-read comic in a sea of lame internet comics." href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/" target="_blank">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a>. The first frame of which is this:</p><div

style="text-align: left;">The question alluded to in the final frame is the same covered by a few writers. Here&#8217;s one: <em><a
title="A Blade of Grass - A great short story over at Escape Pod." href="http://escapepod.org/2011/01/20/ep276-on-a-blade-of-grass/" target="_blank">A Blade of Grass</a></em>, by <a
title="Tim Pratt, Author" href="http://www.timpratt.org/" target="_blank">Tim Pratt</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“You see? Whole cultures could be affected by a parasite. Mass behavioral changes. Insidious. And toxoplasmosis, it’s a parasite that lives in multiple hosts. Starts out in rats and mice. And it changes them — makes them less afraid. Specifically, less afraid of cats. The infected rats don’t run away when they smell cats, so they’re more likely to get eaten by cats, and that’s great for the parasite, because it wants to live inside a cat’s guts, that’s where the parasite can reproduce. They hijack the rats. They just use the rats as a means to an end. Most of the creatures on this planet are just, are just vectors for some parasite.” (Pratt)</p></blockquote><p>This spawned another tangent: a talk that <em>Dan Dennett</em> gave at TED some years back. I had forgotten about it (2004 might as well be the paleolithic era in <em>internet</em> time). Basically, Dan argues that ideas have similar properties. The terminology seems rough &#8211; there&#8217;s surely room to dispute him &#8211; but the concept is so, well, <em>neat</em>.</p><p

The destination often seems to veer toward the nether-zone where human agency butts up against all that we&#8217;re powerless to control. It&#8217;s not a defeatist pursuit (I think). It&#8217;s more a story of me finding fascination in the power and variety of the forces that guide us.</p><p>Maybe it&#8217;s some parasite&#8217;s fault.</p><p><span

title="Mr. Shirmer is one of many interesting people that gets me athinking, even when the brain pictures start to hurt. " href="https://plus.google.com/112214406381263672887" target="_blank">James Shirmer</a>’s Google+ post and just <em>ran with it</em>. So here’s a <a
href="http://longgame.org/category/quick-thoughts/">Quick Thought</a> that I must post before I think better of it&#8230;.</p><h3>So very tired</h3><p><a
href="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/stupid.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13329" title="stupid" src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/stupid-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="240" /></a>I’m tired. Are you guys tired? Politics sure sucks the blood out of me. This is why watching <em>Colbert</em> and<em> TDS</em> is so cathartic. Also drinking.</p><p>I have had to mute two Facebook friends. One is a Republican, the other is a Democrat. Both emit a dull, hate-filled noise in my ears, which is impressive because I’m just reading, you know, <em>text</em>.</p><p>But what do I expect? We’re supposed to have feelings. We’re <em>supposed</em> to care. Right? I do. Re-reading all the comments in this thread drives that home. Of course, the tone is much kinder than damn near anywhere else (outside maybe <em>Buzz)</em>. But it sure doesn’t change <a
title="That ignorant, stupid fool and his dumb vote" href="http://longgame.org/2011/03/that-ignorant-stupid-fool-and-his-dumb-vote/" target="_blank">my feelings of stupidity</a>.</p><p>My attempt to understand all the economic blubbedy-blub hasn’t gone well. I can point at some neat graphs. I know one or two facts. Broadly, I come down on the side of the <strong>vague generalities</strong> posed by progressives. But that&#8217;s more due to loathing the Tea Party. You don&#8217;t get the small government gold star sticker when you&#8217;re keen on perpetuwars, drug wars, and invading everyone&#8217;s uterus.</p><p>I don’t know if it means I <em>am</em> a progressive. I look at party affiliation the way most of us look at tuberculosis. It’s <em>icky</em>. Best not to catch it.</p><h3>My few meager scraps</h3><ul><li>Obama could have raised the ceiling and dared the Republicans to fight it in court. He didn’t.</li><li>Obama is a centrist president. This doesn’t surprise me, in general, but the <em>intensity</em> of his desire to be the centrist president does.</li><li><a
title="Andrew's post: &quot;Dissent Of The Day&quot;" href="http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2011/08/diss.html" target="_blank">Andrew Sullivan’s piece</a> smacks of the bland hope of the outside shot. I can’t say it’s wrong, but that’s only because my time machine is in the shop.</li><li>The crisis may be manufactured by the right, but somebody was going to fabricate it. Those deficit graphs keep inching upward.</li><li>Many pundits on the right are lambasting Republicans because they didn’t squeeze harder.</li><li>I’m increasingly convinced that much of our political culture’s polarization stems from <a
title="My annotations of a very interesting piece about how to reform government." href="http://diigo.com/0iqwp" target="_blank">structural problems</a> in government.</li></ul><p>I don’t know what’ll happen, but, yeah, I think things will get worse. But, what does that look like? I’m already buried in debt. Increasingly large numbers of acquaintances are without jobs. I feel powerless. Where&#8217;s the bottom in this hole?</p><h3>Obligatory generational thingie</h3><p>When I pull back and use my generational thinking cap, I predict a future of more economic suck.</p><p>Eventually, malaise will trigger a mass uprising that makes the Tea Party look like, well, a <em>tea party</em>, like with little girls and stuffed pandas. More change will come to disappoint us, but something valuable will make it through. Maybe later, we’ll get in another war (goodie!). Within the context of the moment, it’ll be considered an existential threat.</p><p>Other things: The government will tax the hell out of us. Boomers will mostly die, which will create an <em>uncompromising principles vacuum</em> that will, no doubt, be filled, especially as my generation gets older. <img
class="size-full wp-image-10762 alignnone" title="The perpetually single ones will get *really* bitter, plus they'll have a lot of time on their hands." src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/fn00.gif" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Maybe, in the mean time, we can do some of that boring structural framework, what with us not collectively bitching about gay marriage and stem cells anymore.</p><p>Maybe the cascade of suck will turn into a kind of improvement. I’m sure the people suffering in the Great Depression never thought their nation would become a major power, land a man on the moon, and then stumble into superpowerhood, when &#8211; oops &#8211; their mortal enemy crumbled.</p><p>But, I don’t know. This, too, is nothing but a gamble. It&#8217;s also ceased being a response. It’s now a post. <em>I didn’t see that one coming and I’m writing the damned thing.</em></p><p>Ask me again what I think about the economy.</p><div

Everyone uses cellphones, nowadays.</em></p><p>Try to imagine all the stuff happening happening within you. A variety of biological processes operates on their own timescales.</p><p>We can picture the timescale of the human life fairly well. It’s more local and tons more personal.</p><p>But what about the lifecycle of cells? What about processes like sleep? Or adolescence, or reproductive systems?

title="Biochronicity - by Alex Mensing at The Long Now Blog (on July 27, 2011)" href="http://blog.longnow.org/2011/07/27/biochronicity/" target="_blank">shines a spotlight</a> on some interesting research over at Darpa. It was brought to his attention via <a
title="Darpa Searches for Life’s Master Clock - by Shachtman &amp; Groeger at Wired's Danger Room (on July 18, 2011)" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/07/darpa-life-master-clock/" target="_blank">a great piece</a> at WIRED’s Danger Room.</p><blockquote><p
dir="ltr">The success of this research could have profound implications for long-term thinking in society. Michael West, a scientist who has been studying human aging and cell mortality since the early 1990s, spoke at The Long Now Foundation’s SALT series in 02004 about “The Prospects of Human Life Extension,” pointing out that an average life-span of 100 years or more would likely change the way that people think about time and how they plan for the future. It was none too many generations ago when few humans lived beyond their forties. (<a
title="Biochronicity - by Alex Mensing at The Long Now Blog (on July 27, 2011)" href="http://blog.longnow.org/2011/07/27/biochronicity/" target="_blank">Mensing</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Heady stuff, but Darpa’s research shouldn’t be confused with the pie in the sky musings of immortality-chasing transhumanists. Nobody’s preparing any longevity patents, just yet. This is Darpa, after all.</p><blockquote><p
dir="ltr">&#8230;it’s clear that all life processes depend on some internal time keeping. This can occur once in a lifetime — say, the hormones released during puberty — or as daily occurrence, as in the regular metabolizing of food into energy. While scientists have uncovered many different components of our inner clocks, “none have been identified as the single lynchpin or master regulator of the greater system that controls temporal expression.”</p><p
dir="ltr">Darpa wants to find the <strong>master regulator</strong>, and then use that knowledge to develop “predictive models of molecular-timed events, cell-cycle progression, lifespan, aging, and cell death, response to stress, and useful treatment strategies and drug delivery.” The key word is predictive. Darpa is no longer content with biology as a descriptive enterprise, watching cells and enzymes do their thing. Now, it wants mathematical models and algorithms and theories to tell what they’ll do next. (<a

class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13318" title="death" src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/death-183x300.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="240" /></p><p>It’s certainly ambitious; it’s also daunting. The regulator mechanism will probably defy expectations. Or this could all be a trip down <em>Blind Alley</em>, but hey, that’s science, too.</p><p>While taking the long view of time has been standard practice in geology, cosmology, and physics for a while, there’s been little effort to pull it all together in the biological sciences. And though I poked fun at the trans-humanists earlier: Yes, longevity science could <em>certainly</em> use a boost.</p><p>As an armchair life-watcher, myself, I’ll have fun waving my little pennant. Death always seems to make a slow start, but my, how that 100% success rate creeps up on me in the end. It has my rapt attention.</p><div
