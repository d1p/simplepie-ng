					<p>First of all, thank you for your enthusiastic support over the past four years. Your continued engagement 
						with our these applications means a lot to us here at LivingSocial, and we're sad that we haven't been able to
						dedicate the time and effort you deserve to keep this community alive and thriving.	</p>
						<p>It's not you. It's us. You see — about two years ago — we tried a new idea, which has taken our team and company 
							in a new direction. This community needs tools and products that are fully supported and continually improved, and unfortunately, this is
							something we just can't support right now.</p>
							<p>We know your data is important to you. Before we discontinue the service, we gave you 30 days to save it.</p>
							<p>We have helped many of you do just that and migrate to other applications around the internet, such as GoodReads, LibraryThing, etc. </p>
							<p>On August 12th, 2011, we shut down this suite of applications. </p>
							<p style="margin-top:10px">If you have any concerns/questions or just want to say hi (or grr!), you can reach us at  interests@livingsocial.com</p>
