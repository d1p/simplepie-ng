      <title>New band of the day – No 1,118: Look, Stranger!</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/65977?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C118%3A+Look%2C+Stranger%21%3AArticle%3A1642187&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Pop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CIndie+%28music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Indie%2CPop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Oct-03&amp;c8=1642187&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FPop+and+rock" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Time to get acquainted with these purveyors of sonic opulence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Thom Hosken (percussion), Tim Sheinman (vocals), David Isaacs (keyboards), Alister Wedderburn (guitar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; For every new band wanting to sound garage-y and raw, there will be another whose intention it is to sound glossy and pristine. The ratio probably isn't 50-50 – more bands want to sound like early Stones/Stooges than, say, Steely Dan and Scritti Politti, possibly because efficiency and polish aren't "sexy" – but certainly there are a few. And we're written about some of them in this column. There was &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/14/new-band-jensen-sportag" title=""&gt;Jensen Sportag&lt;/a&gt;, whose surfaces were so shiny you could see &lt;a href="http://www.recordproduction.com/gary_katz.htm" title=""&gt;Gary Katz's&lt;/a&gt; reflection in them. There was &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/01/new-band-destroyer" title=""&gt;Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; doing their level best to rescue sonic opulence and instrumental excellence from critical hell on their album Kaputt. There was &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/30/new-band-gayngs" title=""&gt;Gayngs&lt;/a&gt; and their etiolated muzak. And, more recently, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/23/new-band-nzca-lines" title=""&gt;NZCA/Lines&lt;/a&gt; created a sound so lustrous and smooth it veered perilously close to jazz-funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now here come Look, Stranger!, the latest bunch who think being dexterous and professional counts for more than being ramshackle and confessional. Like their peers, they've achieved their big-budget sound on the cheap, recording in a west London attic where they make their tracks "so clean it's like Nasa have been polishing them", as one reviewer put it. They got together in a regular rock band way, schoolfriends who bonded during an all-night walk across the Isle of Wight. And they do regular rock band things like play gigs, although they have no drumkit and their stage set apparently resembles a spaceship with its various spiral cymbals, control panels and rope lighting. Do spaceships have spiral cymbals, control panels and rope lighting? We weren't aware that they did. And there are further rock-kudos points from their backstory involving early recording sessions in the world's largest porn film complex and a pole-dancing room. None of which is evident on their two singles, which comprise some seriously sophisticated songwriting and playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were released in quick succession, suggesting a group with a lot of ideas and sufficient ability to not make the results sound ragged and rushed. Quite the opposite, as we've been saying. The title track of the first EP, If You're Listening, makes us think of Roxy Music circa Avalon if they were an indie band influenced by Wild Beasts, which would be a preposterous role-reversal but still, stick with us. The production is classy and the vocals falsetto – as with last week's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/28/new-band-milagres" title=""&gt;Milagres&lt;/a&gt; it's not fit to breathe the same rarefied air as Associates, but we are wont to say that whenever we hear a high-voiced male singing over white funk with krautrock inflections and a MOR sheen. Look Around You is bouncy and catchy yet somehow oblique and arty. It's clearly the work of intelligent young men, and if it's overly decorous, well, doesn't that make a change? Calling a song Dance Away threatens to prove our theory about Look, Stranger! being purveyors of Roxy-style languid disco; sadly, it's not a cover of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMSeOFyskRk" title=""&gt;Ferry and Co's 1979 suave classic&lt;/a&gt;. Wade Out reminds us of Thomas Dolby's productions for Prefab Sprout in the 80s. Now there's an avenue worth re-exploring: complex, jazzy chords treated to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpm0BBt7SGk" title=""&gt;shimmery sonics&lt;/a&gt;. The new single, Kept It Alive, offers sleek white funk that could easily, in the wrong hands, become tepid. Finally, To the River is six minutes of liquid loveliness whose inauspicious title suggests dusty Americana whereas it couldn't be more glacial and European. Kasabian fans will hate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Look, Stranger! are probably the best band that you've never heard of! And definitely should have!" – Communion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; They're not wild or beastly, but they are the new Wild Beasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Dance away the heartache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD_DyoB4Cjs" title=""&gt;Buy a thrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; Kept It Alive (b/w To the River) is released on 7 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Wild Beasts, Milagres, Destroyer, Blue Nile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://lookstranger.bandcamp.com/" title=""&gt;lookstranger.bandcamp.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; Body Language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/indie"&gt;Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>New band of the day – No 1,117: Childish Gambino</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/28935?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C117%3A+Childish+Gambino%3AArticle%3A1641341&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Hip-hop+%28music+genre%29%2CRap+%28music+genre%29%2CUrban+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Pop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-30&amp;c8=1641341&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FHip-hop" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;As comedians dabbling in rap go, Donald Glover has lot more going on than Will Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; Stone Mountain, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Donald Glover (vocals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; You've got to sit up and pay attention to someone about whom New York's esteemed Village Voice has said: "He is running at breakneck speed, criss-crossing the country fuelled by ambition and whiskey and girls, heading toward a moving target that is flashing either 'Next Big Thing' or 'Next Tragic Hero' – all depending on how the next year plays out." And there's plenty to pay attention to. As well as rapping as Childish Gambino, Donald Glover is an actor, writer and comedian. A pretty successful one: he's written for The Daily Show and 30 Rock, had his own specials on Comedy Central, has a lead role in the US sitcom Community, and his viral videos as part of the &lt;a href="http://splitsider.com/2011/09/why-derrick-comedys-mystery-team-deserves-cult-classic-status" title=""&gt;Derrick Comedy team&lt;/a&gt; have been watched more than 200m times. Earlier this year, he undertook the "I Am Donald" tour that combined all his talents and enterprises, taking in hip-hop, comedy, and viral sketch video. He's about to explode all right – that's if, as the Village Voice warned, he doesn't implode first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen him do a mean impression of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1SS2mE6Aqs" title=""&gt;Chris Rock&lt;/a&gt; and he does a great bit about an ex-girlfriend getting mad with him because he cheated on her in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92jNokHpXBI&amp;feature=related" title=""&gt;HER dreams&lt;/a&gt;, but until we start going dilettantish like Glover himself and get given a spin-off called New Standup of the Day, it's the music he's been making as Childish Gambino (chosen from a Wu-Tang Clan rap name generator, apparently) that we're here to assess. He's been putting out albums and mixtapes for a while, but this November will see his first physical release, on the Glassnote label, US home of Mumford &amp; Sons and Phoenix. And he's racked up millions of YouTube views for three videos: Freaks and Geeks, a version of Jamie xx's remix of Adele's Rolling in the Deep, and his take on Kanye West's All Out the Lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title alone of Freaks and Geeks is interesting, positing Glover/Gambino as a new rap archetype, the "black nerd". With his lyrics about family, schoolyard bullying, troubled relationships, suicidal tendencies and alcoholism, one magazine called him a "nerdy emo with a fro" while he's described himself as a "decrepit Drake". The kid who grew up a Jehovah's Witness and seemed, at school, to be the lead character in his own series of Everybody Hates Don, the sole black kid into the Muppets and Korn, from the tracks we've heard he can veer from rap-standard bravado and penile dementia to dreamy reveries, as wildly eclectic as his career has been to date. We haven't yet been struck by anything as astonishing as Tyler, the Creator's French or Earl Sweatshirt's Earl, but certainly there are wittily arresting moments and an intriguing variety of music. On Be Alone he threatens to "set the game ablaze – I'm an Arcade Fire" and almost comes up with a therapy-confessional to match &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFTLouiUFjI" title=""&gt;Bastard&lt;/a&gt;. On Freaks and Geeks there are further allegiances to the indie community as Ariel Pink gets a shout-out while Bitch, Look At Me Now samples Grizzly Bear. Fuck It All is the second best song about suicide we've come across this year after Frank Ocean's Swim Good as Glover relives his schoolyard hell at the hands of bullies. He can do Lil Wayne-ish comic stuff, he can do manic high-energy a la Waka Flocka Flame, and he can do solipsist navel-gazing. And that might just be one song. "Right now, I refuse to even have a dog," he says. "No girlfriend. I don't want anything tying me down. I want to be everywhere. I don't see a limit for me. I want to do everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Donald Glover is one seriously talented dude" – &lt;a href="http://theywillrockyou.com/2011/05/review-donald-glover-childish-gambino-paradise-boston-ma/" title=""&gt;theywillrockyou.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; As comedians dabbling in rap go, there's a bit more going on here than Will Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Blow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Have a day off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; The official debut album Camp will be released by Glassnote on 1 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Waka Flocka Flame, Lil Wayne, Drake, Lil B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.childishgambino.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;childishgambino.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; Look, Stranger!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/hip-hop"&gt;Hip-hop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/rap"&gt;Rap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/urban"&gt;Urban music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Actually, we're not sure if he is her life partner, but they are boyfriend and girlfriend. We're not saying that to spend all your days with this young woman would be a trial, but we are talking here about someone with a rather jaundiced view of relationships. "Throw me in the dirt-pit," she sings on a track called Landfill, only to add later in the same song that, "I want you so much/ But I hate your guts." Daughter's world is full of pain and drama, the kind of place you might want to holiday in if you were feeling particularly masochistic, but not necessarily live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are about to release an EP on &lt;a href="http://www.communionmusic.co.uk" title=""&gt;Communion&lt;/a&gt;, and if you thought that label was all about cosy folk, Daughter are about to change your minds. If this is folk, it's the fucked-up and fucked-around-with variety. Not too much, though – it's not the avant-garde side of experimental, just a little moody and electronicised, brooding and ambient. Enya meets Eno, or something. Tonra, 21, began performing as a stripped-down acoustic singer but meeting Haefeli meant that Daughter would be more than just a voice, and care would be taken with texture and melody. "I got a bit bored of just me and my guitar," as Tonra, recently described as the &lt;a href="http://www.whosjack.org/magazine-issue-45-2" title=""&gt;Future of London Music&lt;/a&gt;, put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's just as well, really, that the focus won't just be on the singing because after a while it could grate. Think the kooky/quirky axis, only more Diana Vickers than Björk. It works as an element of a musical whole but you wouldn't want to leave it unadorned for too long. Luckily, Tonra seems to have come to this realisation, because from her first EP, His Young Heart, to the current one, Wild Youth, there has been an increased attention to detail, to keyboard layers and haunting atmospherics. Love, for example, the last track on the EP, builds and builds, to the point where one of the commenters on Daughter's SoundCloud compares it to the Blue Nile in terms of "sound and architecture", which we hadn't thought of but isn't too far off now that they mention it. The best tracks are the ones where Tonra merges with the music, her vocals just a spectre in the mist. Medicine is a Coldplay ballad in all but name, but we like the Joy Division/New Order-style one-word titles. Youth plumbs Ian Curtis depths of bleakness. "All our feelings are dead," she sings, adding, "You broke my chest." Notice she said chest, not heart. More visceral somehow. Her lyrics are intriguing even if they do overly self-consciously strive for the level of poetry. Then again, The Woods opens with the line, "I asked St Christopher to find your sister", which pretty neatly conflates religious piety and murder mystery. And it rhymes. Promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Masterfully blends fluttering, heart-on-the-sleeve acoustic ballads with brooding, ambient soundcapes" – &lt;a href="http://www.vogue.com/culture/article/artist-of-the-week-daughters-elena-tonra" title=""&gt;vogue.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; She can be as dolorous as &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/doloresoriordan" title=""&gt;Dolores&lt;/a&gt; and strident as Sinead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Stretch out on your grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Go raving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; The Wild Youth EP is released by Communion on 21 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Björk, Diana Vickers, Enya, Dolores O'Riordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/ohdaughter" title=""&gt;facebook.com/ohdaughter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; Childish Gambino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/indie"&gt;Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/electronicmusic"&gt;Electronic music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/15912?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C115%3A+Milagres%3AArticle%3A1640026&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Pop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Pop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-28&amp;c8=1640026&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FPop+and+rock" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;This band's name means 'miracles' in Portuguese, which is appropriate given that they sound a lot like Coldplay and yet don't make you want to stab yourself in the ear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Kyle Wilson (vocals), Fraser McCulloch (bass, vocals, keyboards), Eric Schwortz (guitar, vocals, percussion), Chris Brazee (keyboards) and Steven Leventhal (drums).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Look, we're just going to come right out with it. Milagres sound like Coldplay. There, we said it. See? That wasn't so bad, was it? After all, it's not a crime. Not yet anyway, although Chris Martin's onstage manoeuvres should be &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWRW2qH0ts8" title=""&gt;punishable by law&lt;/a&gt;. That man has all the charisma of a lamp. And yet Coldplay continue to exert a fascination, not on us, that's for sure, but on millions of people unable to distinguish between the original and the merely functional. But influential? Only in the sense they proved a conduit for Bends-era Radiohead and so any bands affected by the former were inevitably swayed by the latter. But we digress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is quite possibly a degree-level thesis to be written about how young men of a certain social and economic strata are bound to sound a certain way, to share a grain of voice and musical intent, but we don't have time for that now. Besides, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/02519c69-7c35-4b79-ad8b-28711b0c68c4" title=""&gt;Milagres&lt;/a&gt; frontman Kyle Wilson has enough problems. He went rock climbing in British Columbia after running out of ideas and options in New York, only to fall while scaling one of the remotest peaks and break his back, resulting in months of tedious recuperation. There is quite possibly a degree-level thesis to be written about how young men of a certain social and economic strata wind up in hospital and there make career-changing decisions, although as far as we know it would only feature three musicians: &lt;a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/scritti-politti" title=""&gt;Scritti Politti's Green Gartside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nerve.com/music/five-things-your-favorite-indie-band-owes-to-brian-eno" title=""&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt; and Kyle Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartside switched from anarcho squat-punk to silky soul and lovers rock from his sick bed, Eno discovered ambient, but Wilson? Well, we don't know what Milagres sounded like before his accident, but now they sound like that bad dancer and his band of merry men. Actually, they're better than that makes them sound. Maybe that's why they called themselves Milagres, which apparently means "miracles" in Portuguese, because miraculously they sound a lot like Coldplay and yet don't make you want to stab yourself in the ear. In fact, their forthcoming debut album Glowing Mouth is quietly impressive, and by "quietly" we mean the opposite. Wilson's delivery is dramatic but precise, keen to be heard, his lyrics evidently important to him. The word is "portentous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think Tears for Fears, or for a more modern reference point, Wild Beasts – Wilson's voice keeps threatening to break into a falsetto and has vaguely operatic pretensions, and his band invest everything they play with a sense of grandeur. He's not even on the same planet as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTXquAe25vI&amp;feature=related" title=""&gt;Billy Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt;, but still, full marks, or some marks anyway, for trying. One of the songs has the swirl of Teardrop Explodes. We're aware that we're mentioning some real heavy-hitters here, but we're only saying they sound like them, not that they're as good as them. We applaud effort and ambition round these parts. It's not all about the achievement; sometimes it's enough to aim high even if you only reach halfway. And other platitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "New tunes so hip, so clean, and so strangely adorable, they're almost sickening" – &lt;a href="http://www.imposemagazine.com/reviews/glowing-mouth--milagres" title=""&gt;imposemagazine.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; They're not quite worth breaking your back or climbing a mountain for, but they do have a certain charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Toy with ambient techno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Have a lovers rock phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; Glowing Mouth will be released next January by Memphis Industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Wild Beasts, Clock Opera, Tears for Fears, Teardrop Explodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.milagresmusic.com" title=""&gt;milagresmusic.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; Daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>New band of the day – No 1,114: Tashaki Miyaki</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/27/tashaki-miyaki-new-band</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/46690?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C114%3A+Tashaki+Miyaki%3AArticle%3A1639367&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Pop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CIndie+%28music+genre%29%2CCulture&amp;c5=Indie%2CPop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-27&amp;c8=1639367&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FPop+and+rock" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Menace and mystery surround this female Jesus and Mary Chain, whose vocals cut like honey-coated razor blades&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Tashaki (vocals) and Miyaki (guitars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Today's column is brought to you from a poolside in Tunisia. We say this not to boast that we're in a better place than you but to highlight the irony of telling you about a band of happy-when-it-rains types from a country that includes within its borders the Sahara Desert. Then again, the people of LA, Tashaki Miyaki's home town, have always been into dark stuff, treating the Cure like superstars and making Morrissey feel like an exiled king. We also once travelled to Beirut with Marc Almond, where we saw him get mobbed at the airport and generally welcomed like a black-clad god, so maybe we're tuning into some north African/Middle Eastern goth sensibility or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also mention the Tunisia thing because we've got a terrible broadband connection here and so are struggling to check details on the web about Tashaki Miyaki, to the extent that we don't know which one's Tashaki and which Miyaki, although this does perhaps play into their hands because what little surfing we've been able to do reveals that they're one of those outfits keen to retain a degree of mystery and anonymity. All we know for sure is that they have a self-titled EP released soon on the Sounds of Sweet Nothing (the label behind excellent recent New Bands of the Day &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/16/gross-magic-new-band" title=""&gt;Gross Magic&lt;/a&gt; and Unknown Mortal Orchestra), and that they will be performing at the 100 Club in London tomorrow night, which we won't be able to attend because, as we say, we're in Tunis, where we'll probably still be attempting to Google who's on drums in the band even as you watch them play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubtless they'll be unveiling tracks from their forthcoming self-titled EP. The first track, Somethin' Is Better Than Nothin', posits TM as a female Jesus and Mary Chain, which is great because the least appealing thing about the Mary Chain was Jim and William Reid's sullen male schtick (discuss). The vocals are from the Debbie Harry school of sounding sweet and then kicking your face in. It's lovely – just like honey, in fact, only watch out for the razor blades. All I Have to Do Is Dream is a cover of the Everly Brothers ballad, only slower, like a funeral march on Mogadon. You'll like it if you always believed the original needed a little fuzz and feedback to tease out the sense of menace, and if you found Don and Phil excessively cloying. Also, this makes the lyric sound more like a threat than a promise, which is nice. They've done a cover of Sam Cooke's Nothing Can Change This Love, too, that goes, "You're the boy of my dreams?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Sam really sing that? Probably not. He was many things, but soul's first gay star he wasn't. Not unless something happened during that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke#Controversy" title=""&gt;fateful night at the motel&lt;/a&gt;  that we, and LA's finest, are not privy to. Best Friend is really strung-out. Tashaki, or it could be Miyaki, sings, "I will be your best friend" and makes it sound like she really means "your drug buddy". It's a three-chord drone based on the Velvet Underground's oeuvre, by which we mean the Velvets of Pale Blue Eyes not Venus in Furs. Happiness is faster, featuring rhythms that make &lt;a href="http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/shop_image/uploads/Image/jamc-danceteria-8.jpg" title=""&gt;Bobby Gillespie's early stand-up drumming with the Mary Chain&lt;/a&gt;  seem like the height of sophistication. It's total Spector sugar-pop with lashings of whine from a new band who put the "psycho" and "candy" into Psychocandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "They put the 'psycho' and 'candy' into Psychocandy" – Paul Lester, Guardian New Band of the Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; No, they really do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Become best friends with Best Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to: &lt;/strong&gt;Move to the West Coast.

Time was, he wasn't so much a ubiquitous part of the landscape – he was the landscape. We vaguely recall a magazine back in the 90s, possibly Select, conducting a poll asking who were the most important people in pop, rock, rap, whatever, and top of the list was – what was his name again? Ah yes, Beck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do happen to miss Beck – and by this we mean early Beck, when he seemed to be half slacker-country boy and half smart hip-hop urbanite, not the ersatz Prince of Midnite Vultures, the surrogate Nick Drake of Sea Change or indeed any of his other guises – then you'll want to hear &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/38f0c7ac-46eb-49ca-b3ab-c785ccd05a60" title=""&gt;TV Girl&lt;/a&gt; (although, and this is when things get complicated, hence the brackets, we actually preferred him in surrogate Drake/ersatz Prince mode). Of course, it seems weird to be recommending a new band by conjuring up the memory of a recording artist whose appeal lay in the way he seemed to be a walking, talking amalgam of every music genre since the 60s, but there you go. It's not our world (formerly, as we say, Beck's world), we just live in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Beck came across like a pop artist who might just as easily have made a career as an advertising hot-shot, then it should come as no surprise to learn that TV Girl's mainman Trung Ngo used to have a job in marketing. There's a savviness to his songs, an ironic distance that suggests someone able, as per Beck, to work in any area of music – you name it, you sense he's willing us to dare him, and he'll master it. "I ain't no poet," he sings on the title track of TV Girl's current EP, Benny and the Jetts, "but I'll try like all the rest." But he's no trier, he's part of that breed of American whizkids who can do something/anything. A bit like Beck in the 90s, and a lot like Todd Rundgren in the 70s. In fact, TV Girl, after sampling everyone from Bob Dylan to Tracy Chapman, based their best-known song to date, 2010's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7llQTio5mqc" title=""&gt;If You Want It (You Got It)&lt;/a&gt;, on a snippet – well, a sizable part of the intro, plus a chunk of the chorus – of Rundgren's 1973 US hit, Hello It's Me. And it came out fine, a real blast of old-style AM radio magic put through a chillwave memory haze, until all websites featuring the tune were politely requested by Rhino Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group, to remove the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shame, because it could have served the dual purpose of spreading the word about TV Girl and alerting people to the genius of Rundgren, still an overlooked talent, admittedly a funny thing to say about someone who produced one of the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGeDn3teKUM" title=""&gt;biggest-selling albums in history&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it's not the only jewel in their crown. That four-track Benny and the Jetts EP really is quite marvellous, from Baby You Were There – which is so faithful a recreation of pre-Brit Invasion American pop it's surely a cover of an old Paul Anka or Neil Sedaka hit – to Lizzy Come Back to Life, which recalls Beck circa New Pollution and rhymes "Richard Hell" with "gazelles". So go and check that out, then report back if and when you've heard anything about the whereabouts of that Hansen fella – we said &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/videotheque" title=""&gt;Hansen&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href="http://media.lunch.com/d/d7/206566.jpg?3" title=""&gt;Hanson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Lo-fi bubblegum pop for the children of chillwave" – &lt;a href="http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/nov/17/blurt-tv-girl/" title=""&gt;sandiegoreader.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth: &lt;/strong&gt;They're mellow gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to: &lt;/strong&gt;Do a Crocodile Rocck EP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a documentary detailing &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2klxLisYURk" title=""&gt;Trung Ngo&lt;/a&gt;'s hissy fits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; The Benny and the Jetts EP is available on TV Girl's bandcamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Wavves, Todd Rundgren, Harry Nilsson, Magnetic Fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://tvgirl.bandcamp.com/" title=""&gt;tvgirl.bandcamp.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday's new band: &lt;/strong&gt;Tashaki Miyaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>New band of the day – No 1,112: NZCA/Lines</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/23/new-band-nzca-lines</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/61349?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C112%3A+NZCA%2FLines%3AArticle%3A1637989&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Pop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Pop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-23&amp;c8=1637989&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FPop+and+rock" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;This Londoner's pleasingly polished debut sees him striving to make pop as perfect as Timbaland used to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Michael Lovett (vocals, instruments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk about changes of direction. The last time we heard, Michael Lovett was playing bass and singing backing vocals in a pop-rock outfit called &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/26/new-band-your-twenties" title=""&gt;Your Twenties&lt;/a&gt;. Today, he's operating as a one-man band with the avowed intention of being "our" answer to Timbaland circa Aaliyah's&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEF_-IcnQC4" title=""&gt; Try Again&lt;/a&gt;, with himself doing both parts – ie the quixotic production and the cooing cyborg vocals. We're deadly serious. So is Lovett: "Aaliyah is a big influence on my vocal sound," he said. "Right at the beginning, when [I was] working out how best to represent these songs, I accidentally found the a cappella for Try Again, and it blew me away. I'm a big fan of R&amp;B in general, such as &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jan/06/ciara-basic-instinct-cd-review" title=""&gt;Ciara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/rihanna" title=""&gt;Rihanna&lt;/a&gt;, because it can yield the greatest pop songs. You've got all these incredibly talented people working to create a product that's just … perfect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's one of those things that indie musicians have long paid lip service to – the desire to make pop as perfect as American R&amp;B producers. Canada's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7rTBe1f57k" title=""&gt;Junior Boys&lt;/a&gt; came closest with Last Exit, their 2004 homage to the rhythmic tricksiness, starkness and sophistication of R&amp;B (and UK garage). And Franz Ferdinand flirted with avant-funk, at least theoretically, in 2008 when they &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/27/news.franzferdinand" title=""&gt;worked briefly with Britain's own dance-pop hit machine Xenomania&lt;/a&gt;, but they bottled it at the 11th hour and made, well, another Franz Ferdinand album. But then, it's a lot easier to bash out tracks on guitar, bass and drums than it is to collude with a studio sorcerer and create something as unearthly and strange as Try Again, which despite being 11 years old still sounds as though it was beamed in from another planet in the far-flung future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lovett, luckily for us, is determined to realise his ambitions. We're not sure why he's named the project after the ancient &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Lines" title=""&gt;geoglyphs in the Peruvian desert&lt;/a&gt;, but we like his choice of collaborators: Ash Workman, producer/engineer for Simian Mobile Disco and Metronomy, and &lt;a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/7263/1/charlie-alex-march" title=""&gt;Charlie Alex March&lt;/a&gt;, a composer and producer whose pre-recording advice to Lovett was to put away all guitars and immerse himself in the music of Ciara and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/igor-stravinsky" title=""&gt;Stravinsky&lt;/a&gt;. You probably won't be surprised to learn that the results veer more towards the former than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven tracks we've heard from NZCA/Lines' 2012 debut album are pleasingly polished, recalling some of the 80s artists who successfully absorbed the influence of then-contemporary black music (notably &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbc8Raofnc8" title=""&gt;Scritti Politti&lt;/a&gt;), as well as Junior Boys, and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/hot-chip" title=""&gt;Hot Chip&lt;/a&gt;. We'd like to think the first single, Compass Points, is titled after the famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_Point_Studios" title=""&gt;studios in the Bahamas&lt;/a&gt; where slick musicianship and rhythmic proficiency reigned, while Lovett's falsetto is at least as accomplished as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o02Q7PghtG8&amp;feature=related" title=""&gt;Jamie Lidell&lt;/a&gt;'s in the surrogate-Prince stakes, even if no one's going to mistake him for Ciara. Okinawa Channels moves at a Hot Chip-circa-&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-fu1PQWTBk" title=""&gt;Boy from School&lt;/a&gt; pace, the briskness contrasting with mournful, contemplative vocals. Work has the hi-gloss of a &lt;a href="http://www.flytetyme.com/html/index_frames.html" title=""&gt;Jam and Lewis&lt;/a&gt; production, and Lovett gets the syncopated sighing just right. It's as lustrous and smooth a combination of programmed beats and "proper" musicianship as that offered by those other modern exponents of dexterous latterday jazz-funk, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/14/new-band-jensen-sportag" title=""&gt;Jensen Sportag&lt;/a&gt;, on their sublime Mapquest EP. Best of all, though, is Moonlit Car Chase. Like everything Lovett does, it has a hi-falutin' concept – it's about a death pact between a cryogenically frozen couple – and a melody that won't quit. With its chilling synths, stuttering rhythms and a soulful turn from Lovett, it's one of the most formally perfect songs of the year. Not quite up there with Try Again, perhaps, but then, not even Timbaland is that good these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Lush waves of electronic sounds, heavily influenced by Aaliyah" – &lt;a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/11185/1/los-nzca-lines" title=""&gt;Dazed and Confused&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; He's done power pop and glossy R&amp;B. Next stop: Stravinsky-influenced neo-classical funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Move to the Bahamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Move to the Peruvian desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; Compass Points is out now. An album will be released next year by Lo Recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Jensen Sportag, Toro Y Moi, Metronomy, Hot Chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nzca-lines.com/" title=""&gt;nzca-lines.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; TV Girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>New band of the day – No 1,111: Erin K and Tash</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/22/new-band-erin-k-tash</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/80013?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C111%3A+Erin+K+and+Tash%3AArticle%3A1637275&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Indie+%28music+genre%29%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Indie%2CPop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-22&amp;c8=1637275&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FIndie" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Nice girls singing jaunty melodies? Don't you believe it – there's more to these two than meets the inattentive ear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; Texas and Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Erin Kleh (vocals, guitar), Tash ter Braak (vocals, guitar), Paul Durbin (percussion), and Nicolas Cornu (guitar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Texan ex-pat Erin Kleh and Dutch &lt;em&gt;émigré&lt;/em&gt; Tash der Braak look, and sound, like such nice girls. Or at least they do until you listen past the briskly strummed guitars and jolly, jaunty melodies and pay attention to what they're singing. The first track we played by this unsigned duo (and band), Heart Out, seemed, at first, almost offensively inoffensive. Then we played it again and we heard what turns out to feature a typically Erin K and Tash-ish contrast between amiable tunefulness and acid wit. How so? Well, the lyrics are about what the boy in the song is going to have to do to make the female protagonist forget about him now that they've split up, and this happens to include: tearing out her heart, sucking the air from her lungs, gouging out her eyeballs, and severing her head. The sort of things, it occurs to Erin K, or possibly Tash, that a chef would do to a lobster, "only much less humane".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's all very Bridget Jones, or Sex and the City relocated from SoHo to Soho. More songs about MacBooks and small penises. Sometimes, the dinner-party pleasantness of the songs and single-entendre ribaldry of the lyrics cast Erin K and Tash as a musical Mel and Sue, or a female &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGOohBytKTU" title=""&gt;Flight of the Conchords&lt;/a&gt;. They call what they do "anti-folk", but this is a million campfires away from Devendra Banhart or Kimya Dawson. They might sing about fuck buddies and sexual frustration, but you could imagine them doing this stuff on a revamped &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK7_cTHpip4" title=""&gt;Pebble Mill at One&lt;/a&gt;. OK, maybe Pebble Mill at One in the Morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could certainly picture &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DskJNUdvMSA" title=""&gt;Alan Titchmarsh&lt;/a&gt; introducing Jiggy Miggy, and its tale of stalking a hot barman with a giant member and a no-strings approach to sex. "I know you're not mine, and that's just fine," they sing, striking a wistful note. Yes, Titchmarsh &lt;a href="http://uktv.co.uk/home/item/aid/1111" title=""&gt;would love that one&lt;/a&gt;. We're not sure what Clippety-Clop is about, apart from "a bloke who sells peanuts on the street, puts sand in his weed, and sugar in his speed". Nor is it exactly clear what point they're making on Sorry I'm Not Black, but we love the way it rhymes "African people" and "steeple" and "hardcore style" with "caucasian denial". Dennis Rodman gets a namecheck, and so does Amy Winehouse, and if it's racist ("A nightmare for you would be sex with a ghost"), it would be towards white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On The Sexy Cupcake they return to their specialist subject: think an updated These Boots Are Made for Walking, only with spoon-licking and extra creamy icing. By Anorexic Girl, it's all got a bit &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETQfuzNGT58" title=""&gt;Phoebe from Friends&lt;/a&gt; and you start to OD on whimsy. Luckily, there are straighter numbers in their repertoire such as Oh Well, and Coins, which has a fuller, poppier arrangement and is worthy of Suzanne Vega, the greatest of all the rock Vegas, apart from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNO5f4yO_g&amp;feature=related" title=""&gt;Alan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Somewhere in the world Erin K &amp; Tash are together, laughing and singing about how small your penis is" – &lt;a href="http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/music/2896" title=""&gt;attnmagazine.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; They're an R-rated Pam Ayres for Generation Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a meal – and get a song – out of moist muffins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Cover Suicide's Frankie Teardrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; The single Coins/Sexy Cupcake is released on 21 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Emmy the Great, Pam Ayres, Mel and Sue, Flight of the Conchords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/ErinKTash?v=info" title=""&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; NZCA Lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/indie"&gt;Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>New band of the day – No 1,110: Exitmusic</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/21/new-band-exitmusic</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/65054?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C110%3A+Exitmusic+%3AArticle%3A1636748&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Indie+%28music+genre%29%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Indie%2CPop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-21&amp;c8=1636748&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FIndie" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;A husband and wife team combining haunted melodies with oceanic arrangements and just a touch of goth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Aleksa Palladino (vocals), Devon Church (guitar, keyboards), Dru Prentiss (drums), Nicholas Shelestak (electronics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background: &lt;/strong&gt;Another day, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/20/new-band-peaking-lights" title=""&gt;another duo&lt;/a&gt;, also married. But Aleksa Palladino and Devon Church, who form the core of Exitmusic, have kept their own surnames because they each have their own careers. Palladino, the singer, has a thriving one: an actor since she was 14, when she co-starred alongside Scarlett Johansson in 1996 comedy drama &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lucc4SIhaY" title=""&gt;Manny &amp; Lo&lt;/a&gt;, she's a member of the cast of Martin Scorsese's HBO series Boardwalk Empire, in which she plays bohemian artist &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire/cast-and-crew/angela-darmody/index.html" title=""&gt;Angela Darmody&lt;/a&gt;. And for the last couple of years she's also been part of Exitmusic, the drafting-in of drummer Dru Prentiss and electronics whiz Nicholas Shelestak adding ballast to what would have been a quieter, folkier affair. That's pure speculation on our part, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should stick to the facts. Church and Palladino began writing together when Church moved to New York following a year teaching English in Taiwan and India. He was a fan of Radiohead's Kid A, the second Sigur Ros album, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Warp Records. Palladino, meanwhile, grew up in an artistic family, with painter grandparents and an opera singer mother. She got her first guitar aged 12 and her first four-track recorder soon after, so when she met Church it was inevitable that they would form a duo named after a Radiohead track, and turn her acoustic sketches into fuller pieces influenced by Icelandic and Canadian post-rock with electronic touches. The bit where they got married overlooking LA's &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166924/" title=""&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/a&gt; was also, when you think about Exitmusic's noir energy and unsettling loveliness, pretty likely to happen. You can imagine a latterday Lynchian femme fatale singing these torrid melodramas in a darkly fantastical dream sequence. Well, we can, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recorded in Brooklyn, Exitmusic's From Silence EP explores "themes of loss, both personal and universal, the destruction of nature and the destruction of our own nature". Nothing too ambitious. Then again, the video for the EP's lead track, the Sea, is a montage of footage from arthouse film legend &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/26020014" title=""&gt;Andrei Tarkovsky&lt;/a&gt;. The Sea is well titled: you will be engulfed, so dress accordingly. It's a tsunami of pop noise, and yes, it comes in waves. Palladino, the actor and rocker, further multitasks by providing the husky main part and the sighing backing vocal. On The Modern Age you can hear the Warp – or &lt;a href="http://altmusic.about.com/od/2000s/fr/radiohead.htm" title=""&gt;Radiohead do Warp&lt;/a&gt; – influence. Here, Palladino assumes the role of a wrecked torch singer on a song that we're duty-bound to inform you is every bit as good as the Strokes tune of the same title, her voice matching the rising instrumental tumult sob for weary sob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For second track The Hours she changes character again, going for something whispery and playfully Björk-ish. Here, we're picturing her as &lt;a href="http://www.criterion.com/films/173-the-seventh-seal" title=""&gt;a tragic servant girl in an old black-and-white Scandinavian film&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, The Silence is slow and sombre, like tribal music where the tribe are all on Mogadon, or trip-hop meets witch house, if we have to pigeonhole it, and we do. It's kind of a compulsion of ours. At one point, Palladino's vocal is almost – almost – Americana, before a chill descends and the music, and her voice, go somewhere else entirely: goth. She says that when she's writing a song, she becomes breathless, overwhelmed. We envisage the same thing happening to you when you hear the From Silence EP, but that's just us speculating again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "The freakishly talented duo of Aleksa Palladino and Devon Church always makes me think of two sweet kids strolling hand-in-hand into Armageddon" – Los Angeles Citybeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; Think Beth from Portishead meets Warp-tinged Radiohead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Drown you in sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYvQ9jgXzIk&amp;feature=related" title=""&gt;Advertise Old Spice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; EP From Silence is released by Secretly Canadian on 7 November (although it will be available two weeks earlier in selected independent stores).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Sigur Ros, Godspeed You!

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/sep/20/new-band-peaking-lights</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/65741?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C109%3A+Peaking+Lights%3AArticle%3A1636155&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Indie+%28music+genre%29%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Indie%2CPop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-20&amp;c8=1636155&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FIndie" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Wisconsin duo Aaron Coyes and Indra Dunis will lull you under with a beguiling blend of krautrock and dub&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Aaron Coyes and Indra Dunis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; In last week's NME a reviewer of the new Kasabian album reported that band songwriter and inadvertent comedian Serge Pizzorno had chosen the title, Velociraptor!, because "velociraptors used to hunt in fours – they were the rock'n'roll band of the dinosaurs". The statement wasn't just ludicrous, it was also quite poignant, given the rapid rate of extinction of the traditional four-piece rock band. These days, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2011/sep/07/pj-harvey-mercury-prize-video" title=""&gt;solo artists win all the prizes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/29/adele-matches-madonna-chart-record" title=""&gt;sell the most records&lt;/a&gt;, and even triumph when it comes to &lt;a href="http://www.clashmusic.com/news/watch-tyler-the-creator-wins-vma" title=""&gt;good old-fashioned bad-boy behaviour&lt;/a&gt;. And a lot of the most interesting music in pop right now is being made either by individuals or double acts. And of the latter, there is currently a sub-sect of married or at least romantically linked couples, including Summer Camp, Tennis, New Look and now Peaking Lights (we'd need to check the partnership status of Cults and Sleigh Bells before we add them to the list). And although you could argue that pairs who aren't involved may be able to bring more creative tension to the table – and we're thinking here of the strange alchemy and fierce energy propelling duos from Associates and DAF to Yazoo – there's no denying that this marriage thing is working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take 936, the debut album by the Wisconsin twosome of Aaron Coyes and Indra Dunis. It's an appealing mess of psychedelia, krautrock, electronica and dub. Not dubstep – dub. Some of the tracks on the album hint at what might have happened had the Grateful Dead jammed with Amon Duul while King Tubby fiddled with the controls. With narcotised female vocals that make Warpaint &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf5d0x-NtVo" title=""&gt;sound like War&lt;/a&gt;. That sentence makes no sense, but then neither does, on paper, a record mixing up krautrock and dub. 936 is being released here in November on Domino offshoot Weird World, months after being available in the US on the excellent Not Not Fun, the label home of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/23/new-band-la-vampires" title=""&gt;Pocahaunted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/feb/03/new-band-ducktails" title=""&gt;Ducktails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/31/new-band-maria-minerva" title=""&gt;Maria Minerva&lt;/a&gt;. Peaking Lights are already thinking about their second album, due to be self-produced and engineered by Al Carlson (Yeasayer, Oneohtrix Point Never) in NYC under the influence, according to a Coyes blogpost, of "smoother bass lines w/ a heavy dub influence looking outward to private press boogie records, african &amp; latin rhythms and tranced vibrations of the most killer all nite party you've never been to: less cocaine, more weed, a sustained orgasm, maintaining 100% creative control, late hot summer nights, come down chill room and low lit zone, lazer light show, smoke machines, being naked and watching the sun rise".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of that, there is a free-to-download &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/peakinglights/mixxed-up" title=""&gt;megamix&lt;/a&gt; of some of Peaking Lights' current favourite stuff, including veteran jazzer Lonnie Liston Smith, soul woman Betty Harris, plenty of reggae from the vaults, and – particularly exciting for us, this – long-forgotten early-80s Britfunk duo I-Level, the instrumental dubbed-out B-side of whose 1982 club hit &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPMkjslzs70" title=""&gt;Give Me&lt;/a&gt; they employ to trippy effect. And, of course, there is 936 itself. It is, as one of the titles of the album has it, Amazing and Wonderful – a tad decorous in parts, a bit tasteful, but there are repetitive drones here that lull you under and pleasant reminders of the psychedelic properties of dub. Marshmellow Yellow is typical: they lock into a groove and stay there, for over eight minutes, Dunis repeating the word "sweetheart" like the ghost of Sandy Denny intoning mournfully over a combination of Melodica motif, bubbling rhythm and kosmische folk. It might not encourage you to remove your clothes, but it is the perfect soundtrack to Indian summer nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Bewitchingly beautiful and hazy concoction of dub, psychedelia, kosmische and disco" – &lt;a href="http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2011/09/12/domino-scoop-up-peaking-lights/" title=""&gt;junodownload.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; Marriage: it's the new black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Put the dub into double act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsPvigSTeD0" title=""&gt;Do a record with Donovan&lt;/a&gt;. On second thoughts …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; 936 gets a full European release on 21 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; Warpaint, King Tubby, Primal Scream, Augustus Pablo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/peaking+lights" title=""&gt;tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; Exitmusic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/indie"&gt;Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>New band of the day – Daley (No 1,108)</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/93480?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+Daley+%28No+1%2C108%29%3AArticle%3A1635526&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Soul+%28music+genre%29%2CR+and+B+%28contemporary+music+genre%29%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Pop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-20&amp;c8=1635526&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FSoul" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Accomplished and polished, Gareth Daley is the first Brit-soul boy with serious commercial potential since Mick Hucknall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Gareth Daley (vocals, music).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; We might as well get the comparisons out the way: he's a blue-eyed soul boy from Manchester and he's got a stack of high red hair (he looks like "&lt;a href="http://assets.artandculture.com/media-prod/public/uploads/images/60344/Alannah_Currie-1984_thumb_medium.jpg" title=""&gt;Alannah Currie&lt;/a&gt; from the Thomson Twins mixed with Brains from Thunderbirds," according to one reviewer), so it would be remiss of us not to mention &lt;a href="http://780x378-1.ikiwq.com/dzONW7Ld1jBq0CXrT8Xwzc.png" title=""&gt;Mick Hucknall&lt;/a&gt;. But don't let that put you off Gareth "Daley" Daley: Hucknall, before he became synonymous with oleaginous, was cool. Have you heard &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vpsy8PPqFc" title=""&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt;, or better still &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG07WSu7Q9w&amp;ob=av3e" title=""&gt;Holding Back the Years&lt;/a&gt;, lately? Think Tim Buckley if he'd made his 1972 album of lascivious sex-funk in the north of England. Not so much &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/greetings-from-la-r2889" title=""&gt;Greetings from LA&lt;/a&gt; as Greetings from Whalley Range. Daley is on the verge of doing something as fine as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were going to proclaim him the first decent white Brit-soul boy since early Hucknall, but that wouldn't work because thay would be to ignore &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97DmUMPTogc" title=""&gt;Birth&lt;/a&gt;, who bombed chart-wise but produced one great album in 2000's &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Birth-Gotten-Bold/release/1962531" title=""&gt;Gotten Bold&lt;/a&gt;, and of course there was the mighty &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Lewis-Taylor-Bittersweet/release/1077590" title=""&gt;Lewis Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, although he quickly demonstrated a desire to avoid being trapped in any "soul" pigeonhole. In which case, we could probably legitimately argue that Daley is the first soul-boy contender with serious commercial potential since Hucknall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daley, a nominee on this year's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of..._(BBC_poll)" title=""&gt;BBC Sound of 2011&lt;/a&gt; poll, has already had some success, actually, having sung on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh35CYjsfws" title=""&gt;Long Way Home&lt;/a&gt; from Wretch 32's top 5 debut album, and on the Gorillaz track &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJQyTnD74gk&amp;ob=av3e" title=""&gt;Doncamatic&lt;/a&gt;, which he co-wrote with Damon Albarn. Now he's signed to A&amp;M and working on his own debut album, due out in 2012, with Suede guitarist and Duffy producer Bernard Butler as well as Dre of Dre and Vidal (Alicia Keys, Usher) and Shea Taylor (Ne-Yo, Beyoncé).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intriguing mix of collaborators suggests Daley could go in one of several directions, including soulful in a retro-60s way, and shiny in a US urban way. While we await that debut proper, and to offer some signs of his future path, he's put out a free mixtape, Those Who Wait, on his &lt;a href="http://daley.tv" title=""&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. It's accomplished, polished stuff, with a winning melodicism, and although he's had some big-ups on blogs and in the alt-rock press, it posits him as a latterday George Michael, as someone who has absorbed much of the 90s American R&amp;B (Maxwell, D'Angelo) he grew up listening to. It's mainstream with edge. Some of the lyrics need de-cliche-fying, but it's evident from the nine originals (plus a "hidden" supper-club torch song rendition of Madonna's Like a Virgin) that he's less Olly Murs than &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoOfCYwVltI" title=""&gt;David McAlmont&lt;/a&gt;, more idiosyncratic than idiotic and crass. Even when the music veers towards smoov quiet-storm slow jams, Daley refuses to showboat like the pantomime belters on X Factor. And amid the old-fashioned soul there are moments such as the title track, which has a Drake-ish solemnity and sparseness. Listen without prejudice indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Who knew that Manchester had a hot Timberlake-a-likey waiting in the wings?" – &lt;a href="http://www.thehospitalclub.com/features/view/21-06-11-review-angie-stone-at-the-jazz-cafeacute" title=""&gt;thehospitalclub.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; He's the future of homegrown male soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Write a song about self-loathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Become an &lt;a href="http://www.gigwise.com/photos/59957/8/Simply-Reds-Mick-Hucknall-Sorry-To-1000-Women-He-Slept-With" title=""&gt;unctuous lothario&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; The Those Who Wait mixtape is now available to download from &lt;a href="http://daley.tv/" title=""&gt;daley.tv&lt;/a&gt;. Daley's first official release will be early next year, with a single on Polydor, followed by an album in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to: &lt;/strong&gt;Maxwell, D'Angelo, George Michael, David McAlmont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/daleyofficial" title=""&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday's new band: &lt;/strong&gt;Peaking Lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/soul"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/r-and-b"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It happened to us in the 90s after we heard Clouds Taste Metallic by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f87siGRmwYc" title=""&gt;the Flaming Lips&lt;/a&gt;, in the 00s with Radio Dept's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RajZGmijwzo" title=""&gt;Pet Grief&lt;/a&gt;, and again last year when we found out about &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFTLouiUFjI" title=""&gt;Odd Future&lt;/a&gt;. It also happened more recently when we chanced upon &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jul/26/new-band-stewrat" title=""&gt;StewRat&lt;/a&gt;, although luckily his albums were available for free download (as were, of course, OF's until Tyler, the Creator put out &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Goblin-Creator-Tyler/dp/B004OT7PQU" title=""&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Teen Daze, there's quite a lot for pathological collector types like us to acquire, but in this instance you have to pay. But like Jennifer Aniston and her lustrous-haired friends, they're worth it. Or rather, he's worth it: Teen Daze is the name used by Jamison, and Jamison is the first name of the twentysomething from British Columbia who seems to spend an inordinate amount of time in his bedroom, recording singles, EPs and albums, several of which are available for purchase from his &lt;a href="http://teendaze.bandcamp.com/album/a-silent-planet" title=""&gt;bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;. There are two full-length albums, several EPs and some &lt;a href="http://www.gorillavsbear.net/2010/05/20/mp3-teen-daze-remixes-twin-sister" title=""&gt;excellent remixes&lt;/a&gt;. Scout around and you may also learn that he collaborated with New Band of the Day favourite MillionYoung last year on a cover of &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/19781625" title=""&gt;Pink Floyd's Us &amp; Them&lt;/a&gt;, and that he issued a free EP reinterpreting songs by those other NBOTD faves &lt;a href="http://cultusvibes.bandcamp.com/album/reinterprets-selections-from-mend-by-geotic" title=""&gt;Baths&lt;/a&gt;. And in his spare time, the lazy bugger has an ambient/folk/post-rock side project called Two Bicycles, which has its own &lt;a href="http://twobicyclesband.bandcamp.com/" title=""&gt;bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamison – who operates in that nebulous area between dream-pop, ambient, shoegaze and chillwave – uses various aliases to pursue different areas of music: the My Bedroom Floor album, for example, is more dancey, although it's not exactly &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQcg-dRg5h4" title=""&gt;Jack Your Body&lt;/a&gt;, while the Tour EP is downtempo and meditative. But it's all good. And his new stuff's his best yet, which is always nice. Call us old-fashioned, but we prefer it when a musician improves. Teen Daze – and what a great name that is, cleverly connoting a sense of yearning and some of the shimmering haziness of his sound – has just made a six-track EP, A Silent Planet, that takes glo-fi melancholia to new levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We won't do a track-by-track this time because it'll just be an embarrassing gush of superlatives and synonyms for opalescent gorgeousness; suffice to say this is music that can be best described using terms normally found in a GCSE physics text book. And that these are clearly the aftershocks felt by a person too shattered to fully express themselves. Put it this way: there is no bellowing here, just yearning. Oh, and we'd just like to say we really appreciate the way Jamison's voice is transfigured throughout, because what is the human voice but raw material to be reshaped into something superior and, well, inhuman-sounding. We accept this goes against 40 years of argument that singing should be untampered-with and unadorned, but there you go, it's Friday, and we're in charge of this little corner of the universe. Or at least we are until our editor tells us to behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "It would take a hard heart not to be seduced by its superficial beauty" – &lt;a href="http://leonardslair.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/review-teen-daze-a-silent-planet/" title=""&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; Superficial beauty? What other kind is there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Conjure up the aurora borealis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Advertise L'Oreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; A Silent Planet EP is out now on Waaga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; MillionYoung, Baths, Washed Out, Cocteau Twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://teendaze.bandcamp.com/album/a-silent-planet" title=""&gt;bandcamp.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; Daley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/electronicmusic"&gt;Electronic music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/indie"&gt;Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/dance-music"&gt;Dance music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/79280?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C106%3A+MNEK%3AArticle%3A1634036&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Pop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CR+and+B+%28contemporary+music+genre%29%2CUrban+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CCulture&amp;c5=Pop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-16&amp;c8=1634036&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FPop+and+rock" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;This precocious producer could be the next big urban pop boy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; Bellingham, London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Uzoechi Osisioma Emenike (vocals, music).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; There's no way we're going to be anything other than completely kind and complimentary towards Uzoechi Osisioma Emenike, alias MNEK, because he's only 16 and that's way below the age at which critical opprobrium becomes acceptable. Luckily, he's a talented singer, writer, producer and remixer and we don't have to be negative, even if there are things he's done for which we'd get out the old red pen – he's still at school – and come on like concerned teachers. On the whole, though, he'd get a favourable report from us on parents' evening, and his mother and father would leave our classroom smiling and proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we'd have said all of that before we found out that his dad was a detective at Scotland Yard, which for some reason makes us a bit nervous. That his mum bakes cakes for a living bothers us not one jot. Really, though, this is one seriously impressive young man. Look at the stuff he's already got lined up to put on his &lt;a href="http://www.ucas.com/students/apply" title=""&gt;UCAS form&lt;/a&gt;: he's produced for Frankmusik, CocknBullKid, Duran Duran, Florrie, Diana Vickers and Tinie Tempah, NME called him one of the "20 hottest producers in music right now", while the Guardian went one better and ranked him on their &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/26/ten-next-generation-of-producers" title=""&gt;"10 of the next generation of music producers"&lt;/a&gt; list. And he co-wrote the current single by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWn37lqpqXc" title=""&gt;the Saturdays&lt;/a&gt;, which is a total Auto-Tune fest, but it's got a curiously pleasing non-tune (see also Swagger Jagger) that is quite brave in its avoidance of conventional song-structure strictures. And the chorus, such as it is, is great: "We're so close to the edge of desire," it goes (know the feeling). Plus, it's got a breakdown or a drop or whatever it is you call that part on rave tunes where they bring out the synth chords and the beat stops, refusing to return till you're gagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this kid, with the outsize (yeah, we can talk) colourful glasses, gold chains and hi-top fade, who started writing/producing when he was nine, is not just another sucker with a Cameo cut. Earlier this year he created an instrumental, Lunar Riddim, that got used during &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvIHvZJpeUE" title=""&gt;Nike's Air Max Lunar campaign&lt;/a&gt;. He even made Olly Murs bearable with his remix of Heart Skips a Beat, managing to remove all the bumptious end-of-the-pier energy. And now, although currently studying for his GCSEs, he's about to release his debut single. It's coming out on Moshi Moshi, which is interesting because it pitches him as a credible alt artist when he could easily be the next big mainstream urban pop boy – maybe he's done a major-label deal for the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meantime, that first single, If Truth Be Told, is fairly generic but super-catchy urban pop, but as calling cards go, it's certainly bold, and we're delighted to be able to discern in it traces of old-style electro-funk. Apparently, MNEK loves the productions of Jam &amp; Lewis, and you can tell, as well as 80s Britfunk – he's got a track called Detention Love that reminds us of Loose Ends' mighty &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S00JkAwSlCg" title=""&gt;Hangin' on a String&lt;/a&gt; and he namechecks the godlike &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh0hGoESFcE" title=""&gt;Freeez&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIIFdvundw" title=""&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; about himself. There, he also performs an cappella rendition of his song Summer Romance that's pure X Factor cornball melisma overload, at which point we ask to see him after school and invite his parents in for a chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "Meet R&amp;B genius MNEK"  &lt;a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/3550/1/dazed-confused-july-issue" title=""&gt;dazeddigital.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth:&lt;/strong&gt; Call us prescient, but we can see a Uni place being deferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Be into &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mhtwirqe6Lc" title=""&gt;Moshi Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Be confused with Eminem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; If Truth Be Told is released by Moshi Moshi on 7 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; T-Pain, Taio Cruz, Sean Kingston, Labrinth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/MNEKOfficial" title=""&gt;facebook.com/MNEKOfficial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; Teen Daze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/r-and-b"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/urban"&gt;Urban music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Besides, they've got bigger priorities than poking fun at the peculiarities of British fashion, such as recording one of the albums of the year. We are fond of listing our new acts of the year (Odd Future, Jensen Sportag, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jul/26/new-band-stewrat" title=""&gt;StewRat&lt;/a&gt;, AlunaGeorge, Keep Shelly in Athens) and our tracks of the year, but we haven't given much thought to our albums of the year, mainly because there haven't been that many. But now we have a fine addition to the 2011 canon that includes such latter-day quiet-storm classics as Frank Ocean's Nostalgia, Ultra, the Weeknd's House of Balloons and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/17/new-band-class-actress" title=""&gt;Class Actress' Rapprocher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Look's self-titled debut – issued on !K7, home to the mighty Chromeo and the &lt;a href="http://www.dj-kicks.com" title=""&gt;DJ Kicks series&lt;/a&gt; – is almost a companion piece to Rapprocher by Brooklyn's Elizabeth Harper, being an album of electronic pop sung by a female, in this case Sarah Ruba, a part-time model who, with her producer/multi-instrumentalist husband Adam Pavao, has spent the last three years recording New Look in Brooklyn, as well as Berlin and their home town of Hamilton. Apparently, they have experience in ambient jam bands (Pavao) and as jazz belters (Ruba), but mercifully they've put all that behind them and are focusing on shiny dubstep pop, or post-dubstep pop seeing as how it takes some of the rhythmical devices and production methods of dubstep and allies them to pure pop melodies. Yes, it would be nice just once for the producer/sidekick to be the woman and the frontperson/eye-candy to be the man, but these darlings of blogs and the &lt;a href="http://i-donline.com/2011/07/i-n-session-new-look" title=""&gt;style press&lt;/a&gt;, who recently supported the xx on tour, are such masters and mistresses of icy emotionality, we forgive them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're also pretty good self-editors, hence all the lovely dub space in their songs. "We try not to keep anything superfluous in," they explain. "We're always conscious of the negative space in our music and that's a constant theme." They've cornered the market in less-is-more. Nap on the Bow is the perfect blend of crispness and melodic concision. Has there been a single instance of this stuff getting any daytime radio play, though, let alone charting? Possibly not. And yet this feels like a hit, just as New Look's London counterparts, AlunaGeorge, are fantasy top 10 heroes of ours. Relax Your Mind is a brilliantly raw, sparse sort of feminised grime. On Numbers the words are haiku-like in their simplicity but convey just the right amount of fear and yearning: "The telephone is not a toy/ It has power to destroy." Have you ever noticed that? We have, often. A Light has an itchy, quirky arrangement that is more Björk than Benga. The Ballad has the austere atmosphere of Fade to Grey/Being Boiled. So Real is like Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam doing late-90s/early-00s UKG. Does that make it R&amp;G? While you're pondering that, Everything is like a showdown between dub creator Scientist and St Etienne. Ruba visits every song like a hologram of passion, and the music is a mirage of immaculacy. And now we're going to vanish, before we say too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The buzz:&lt;/strong&gt; "They're a super-pop electro synth duo" – &lt;a href="http://www.russhmagazine.com/arts-music/music/2011/07/07/modern-love/" title=""&gt;russhmagazine.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth: &lt;/strong&gt;They're dub-pop taken to the (TK) max(x).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a (Pri)mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least likely to:&lt;/strong&gt; Model for New Look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy:&lt;/strong&gt; The self-titled debut album is released by !K7 on 26 September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File next to:&lt;/strong&gt; AlunaGeorge, Jack the Tab, St Etienne, Dubstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Look/109392795753943" title=""&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/52938df0-6e1a-4b70-82bf-c14a2259a000" title=""&gt;Musicbrainz.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday's new band:&lt;/strong&gt; MNEK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/indie"&gt;Indie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/dubstep"&gt;Dubstep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/electronicmusic"&gt;Electronic music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullester"&gt;Paul Lester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.22.2/8766?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=New+band+of+the+day+*+No+1%2C104%3A+This+Many+Boyfriends%3AArticle%3A1632567&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Indie+%28music+genre%29%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&amp;c5=Indie%2CPop+Music%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Paul+Lester&amp;c7=11-Sep-13&amp;c8=1632567&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=New+band+of+the+day+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FIndie" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;This Leeds band play the sort of indie you'd expect from a group named after a Beat Happening song. But don't call them twee…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hometown:&lt;/strong&gt; Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lineup:&lt;/strong&gt; Richard (lead vocals), Tom (bass), Laura (drums), Dan (lead guitar), Pete (rhythm guitar, backing vocals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; This Leeds five-piece describe what they do as "indie fun-pop", explaining that they "bonded over a shared love of playing music far too loud in rooms far too small", which should tell you quite a lot about what they're like. They've been through "more lineup changes than the Fall" and have settled on one that enables them to approximate the hurtling strums of all the bands you'd imagine. They're named after a 1988 track called &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imUN2JaivE" title=""&gt;The This Many Boyfriends Club by Beat Happening&lt;/a&gt;, which comprised three minutes of a bloke, presumably Calvin Johnson, moaning tunelessly over the sound of a guitar being tortured. It was one of Kurt Cobain's favourites. &lt;a href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/d689dc13-8844-435f-9ce0-af14dda4e48a" title=""&gt;This Many Boyfriends&lt;/a&gt; eschew atonal axe mutilation for the sort of straight, cute indie you'd expect from a group with that name, with its evocation of teen naivete, although they have said that "if anyone calls us twee we'll knock their block off", so be warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't mind being compared to Orange Juice, the Cribs, Hefner and the Smiths, which is just as well, because their influence is all over their two releases: Getting A Life With… EP issued in 2010 by Thee Sheffield Phonographic Corporation, and latest single, Young Lovers Go Pop! on Angular. We can safely predict they won't be compared to the other acts they claim as influences – PJ Harvey, the Slits, Spearmint, Jonathan Richman, Otis Redding and Joy Division – because, frankly, they sound bugger-all like any of them. They've got as much in common with &lt;a href="http://my.greasy.com/host/images/24979851.jpg" title=""&gt;Laurence Harvey&lt;/a&gt; as they have PJ Harvey. On the title track of their new single they pay tribute to local heroes the Wedding Present by borrowing their, well, everything. Wilfully scruffy, it rejoices in its lack of futuristic zeal and features a chorus so indie-disco-friendly it could have been constructed by a crew of robot Freshers. You Don't Need to Worry has some Orange Juice-y jangle and some Moz-ish moroseness, even when it's trying to be upbeat: "You don't need to worry 'bout the future," it goes. "You don't need to feel useless or stupid." It's sooo Smiths, although the reference to Primary School takes C86-style innocence-fetishism to creepy extremes. Paul Simon was so-titled because one of the band loves Paul Simon. In fact, the titles are often better, and certainly more artful, than the songs. There's one called I Don't Like You (Cos You Don't Like the Pastels) and another called I Should Be a Communist. Neither are exactly triumphs of innovative guitaristry, although they have at least improved on their debut EP, which could have been recorded in a bathtub.
