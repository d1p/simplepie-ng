There can be many reasons for this problem  in different people. Some have it just because of the incorrect postures while  injuries may be the reason for this. Depending on the cause people take  different types of treatments. It is essential to take care of this problem at  initial stages itself else it grows to become critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;Arthritis is another common  problem which is seen in the older people. The major difference between &lt;strong&gt;arthritis pain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Back pain&lt;/strong&gt; is that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title="Back pain" href="http://www.uhwg.com.au/pages/Back-Pain.html"&gt;Back pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can be because of any internal and external reason at any stage of life while  arthritis is cased due to internal reasons and is common in elderly people. But  similarity between both these is that the person suffering from any of these  problems, find it difficult to move and manage daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;It is believed that &lt;strong&gt;arthritis pain&lt;/strong&gt; has no treatment but &lt;strong&gt;Back pain&lt;/strong&gt; certainly has, depending on the  cause for the pain. Today there are many medicines and devices which can be  used to relive people from the pain, if not cure it. People suffering from  arthritis simply look to get relief from the pain and they use different  ointments, physiotherapy sessions, special devices for exercise and many other  remedies but only some of them provide relief. Similarly for treating the pain  in back, physiotherapy sessions are very helpful. If the pain is just because  of strain then it can be relieved by some sprays and use of good mattress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;Today there are many companies  who have introduced very effective products in the market which are known to  give great results in treating pain. Some of them are oral pills while others  are exercising and physiotherapy equipments. If you or anyone in your family is  suffering from back or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title="Arthritis pain" href="http://www.uhwg.com.au/pages/Arthritis-Pain.html"&gt;Arthritis pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; then you must find out about these medicines and devices. There are drug free  methods to treat pain in joints and muscles. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation is one such way to treat pain.  It is popularly known as TENS. This method focuses on the neurophysiological  basis of the pain and has different ways to control the reasons which make you  feel the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;You can find enough information about this and there are different equipments  and medicines which are given to the patients under this treatment.

You can order these products and equipments online as well. It  is important to do some basic research about these products because there are  hundreds of them in the market but not all of them are effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;Shopping from reliable sites is the key to buying good and reliable  products. If you shop online, you get a good chance to compare different  products. These products are suitable for professional use by the therapists  and for the home users as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5238197345105369872-3158153923896048201?l=tensmachine.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/feeds/3158153923896048201/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/2011/08/treating-back-and-arthritis-pain-with.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5238197345105369872/posts/default/3158153923896048201'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5238197345105369872/posts/default/3158153923896048201'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/2011/08/treating-back-and-arthritis-pain-with.html' title='Treating Back and Arthritis pain with Modern Day Technology'/><author><name>TENS machine</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14798426528613946394</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5238197345105369872.post-7150269031733825177</id><published>2011-08-18T21:39:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-08-18T21:39:13.669-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Tens Machine'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Arthritis Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Neck Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Back Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Muscle Pain'/><title type='text'>Bottomless Ways to Get Rid Of Back pain &amp; Arthritis pain</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;Arthritis is  a disease which can be caused by several reasons including cyclic motion, sports  activities, strains, over exercise.

Usually &lt;strong&gt;back pain&lt;/strong&gt; occurs because of the muscle imbalances. Muscle imbalance  can cause stress on muscle and bones and put the spine little out of alignment.  This causes severe pain in the back. This has been the most common cause for the &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain. &lt;/strong&gt;Our spine's position has been determined by the  muscle groups like thighs, hips and the upper body even. Firstly we need to make those muscles strong.  For this, we need to do some exercises regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;The style of work and other activities also  contribute imbalances in the body. We need to be cautious about the &lt;strong&gt;back pain&lt;/strong&gt; right from the beginning. The  way we exercise, the way we sit and walk can also cause &lt;strong&gt;back pain.&lt;/strong&gt; Many times when pain is less it goes without noticed.

This  Myofascial pain can catch a single  muscle or a group of muscles. The peculiarity of this is pain in other areas  and trigger point is somewhere else. This type of &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain&lt;/strong&gt; is called as referred pain also. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify" class="style1"&gt;There are few causes of &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain. &lt;/strong&gt;Injury to inter vertebral disc, general tiredness,  repetition of actions, and lastly lack of activity can cause severe &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain.&lt;/strong&gt; Good amount of calcium and protein intake would prevent this pain to certain  extent.

The actual muscle fibers are injured. Muscles  fibers are manacles of muscle cells that are joint together to create a muscle. &lt;strong&gt;Muscle pain or back pain&lt;/strong&gt; is when  ligaments are excessively stretched or frayed. Ligaments are extremely tough,  rubbery linking tissues. The ligaments attach the muscles to their attachments.  Almost every &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; back pain&lt;/strong&gt; arrives from internal tension  and stress. Mental and emotional stress can be root to physical stress and  tension to increase in muscles. And this is the reason that we get 'tight'  emotion when we have angst and unease. The body and the mind are indivisible  and they perform their tasks together all each and every work they do. So, if  the mind has tension and anxiety, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://uhwg.com.au/Muscle-Pain"&gt;muscle pain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; back pain&lt;/strong&gt; is sometimes the straight  answer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;  If you have suffered  from muscle injury in a particular accident, there is a possibility that inner  tension and stress is still to charge. Stress muscles are more vulnerable to  damage. Tense muscles are a consequence of mental or emotional tension and  stress. Make an effort to calm down and relax and spare muscles the ache of  damage. The best option to get rid of &lt;strong&gt;back  pain&lt;/strong&gt; is to lie on the back on the floor along with the pillows below your  knees, with your knees and hips turned and your feet on a chair. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;  The extremely common &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;back pain&lt;/strong&gt; treatment is rest, density and elevation and even ice.  Most fitness, sports and ballet buffs are very well aware of this and keep  handy ice packs always available at home. Person who is suffering from &lt;strong&gt;back pain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain&lt;/strong&gt; should keep an elastic bandage with them to use anytime  during an emergency. When you suffer from muscle pain and back pain after  exercising or performing your daily tasks, you will bring to a close that the  overexertion was reason for that. But if in any case, you haven't performed anything  strenuous and still having &lt;strong&gt;back pain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;muscle pain&lt;/strong&gt; then in that case it  is very essential to get the cause as soon as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;span class="style2"&gt;  Medical help obviously  provides instant relief in several cases. But one thing should be kept in mind  always that prevention is better than cure, muscles should be sued regularly. Muscles  can be maintained in proper shape and toned all the way through regular work  outs, more than ever, nutrition and stretch exercises. When you will use your  unused muscles then it would definitely cause muscle pain. For example, old  people always complain about body pains, and these body pains are normally  caused by unused muscles since they don't use all their muscles in old age. This  results from a period when the flexibility gets decreased and the muscles start  to depreciation. Following a consistent exercise and having a fair balanced  nutritious food providing your body necessary vitamins and minerals can stop  the possibility of&lt;strong&gt; muscle pain &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://uhwg.com.au/Back-Pain"&gt;back  pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5238197345105369872-3437386126573618663?l=tensmachine.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/feeds/3437386126573618663/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/2010/12/muscle-strain-cause-to-back-pain.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5238197345105369872/posts/default/3437386126573618663'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5238197345105369872/posts/default/3437386126573618663'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/2010/12/muscle-strain-cause-to-back-pain.html' title='Muscle Strain cause to - Back Pain'/><author><name>TENS machine</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14798426528613946394</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5238197345105369872.post-3157012218747817879</id><published>2010-12-05T21:07:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2010-12-05T21:07:13.698-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Arthritis Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Neck Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Back Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Muscle Pain'/><title type='text'>Get Relief from Arthritis Pain and Neck Pain</title><content type='html'>&lt;p align="justify" class="style2"&gt;There are more than 100  types of arthritis neck pain and other aching diseases.

But, &lt;strong&gt;Osteoarthritis&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rheumatoid  Arthritis&lt;/strong&gt; are the two main strains. The most common form of arthritis is  Osteoarthritis.

The most  frequently affected joints are in the hands, spine, knees and hips.  Another, Rheumatoid arthritis is a more severe, but less common  condition. The body's immune system attacks and destroys the joint,  causing pain and swelling.

For example, a muscle spasm or cramp   in the calf is an intense pain  that is commonly called a charleyhorse. &lt;strong&gt;Pain in muscles&lt;/strong&gt; can appear when a muscle is affected by an injury, an autoimmune  reaction  and loss of  blood flow to the muscle, infection, or invasion by a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="style1" align="justify"&gt;The most common &lt;strong&gt;joint muscle pain&lt;/strong&gt; is a disease  called Systemic Lupus Erythematosis. &lt;strong&gt;Muscle Joint Pain&lt;/strong&gt; can occur in any part of the body - hips, shoulders and knees are more  prone to this ailment. Excess body weight adds to the woes of patients  suffering from these pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="style1" align="justify"&gt;SIMI Medical has proven &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title="muscle pain" href="http://uhwg.com.au/"&gt;muscle pain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;relief equipment such as the SS Pro, SS Plus, SS Reflectro, and Tri-Abs. These  Devices are able to transmit electrical pulses through the skin surface  and stimulate motor unit nerves and muscles - effectively stimulating  and relieving the muscles. The electrical impulses are "ramped" so that  they closely emulate natural muscle contractions. This Equipment is  affordable and convenient for home use, and will definitely provide  pain relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5238197345105369872-3643133969407661174?l=tensmachine.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/feeds/3643133969407661174/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/2010/12/get-instant-relief-from-muscle-pain.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5238197345105369872/posts/default/3643133969407661174'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5238197345105369872/posts/default/3643133969407661174'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://tensmachine.blogspot.com/2010/12/get-instant-relief-from-muscle-pain.html' title='Get Instant Relief From Muscle Pain Without the Use of Drugs'/><author><name>TENS machine</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14798426528613946394</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5238197345105369872.post-7800194624919233982</id><published>2010-08-25T21:34:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2010-08-25T21:36:55.440-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Tens Machine'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Arthritis Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Neck Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Back Pain'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Muscle Pain'/><title type='text'>Back Pain Relief</title><content type='html'>&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Lower Back Pain is not a specific disease but is a symptom which occurs from a variety of different causes.
