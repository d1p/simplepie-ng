<title>Obligatory Missoni Post</title>

<description>The hype about Target&#39;s collaboration with Missoni was certainly something. It surprised me to see bloggers who are normally hyper critical about quality getting into a frenzy over it all, but I guess I remember the same thing happening with their Orla Kiely collection. The hype got even worse when the collection went live and their website couldn&#39;t keep up. You wouldn&#39;t know it from most of the ridiculously effusive articles out there, but the story wasn&#39;t really that the Missoni collection was SO popular; all of these big collaborations sell out immediately by design. The issue was that they...</description>

&lt;p&gt;The hype got even worse when the collection went live and their website couldn&amp;#39;t keep up. You wouldn&amp;#39;t know it from most of the ridiculously effusive articles out there, but the story wasn&amp;#39;t really that the Missoni collection was SO popular; all of these big collaborations sell out immediately by design. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pressroom.target.com/pr/news/target-launches-redesigned-e-commerce-aug2011.aspx?ncid=25121&quot;&gt;The issue was that they went live with a new e-commerce platform and site redesign just weeks before.&lt;/a&gt; I imagine there was more than a little schadenfreude over at Amazon (their previous e-commerce partner) when all of this went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that I&amp;#39;m immune to the allure of cheap chevron prints. So, I bought myself a little something for that thorn in my side -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chinashepherdess.com/tv-piano-karaoke-room/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;the TV room of doom&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.target.com/p/Missoni-Fabric-Pentagonal-Pouf-Black-White-Zig-Zag/-/A-13565876?ref=tgt_adv_xasd0001&amp;amp;AFID=Performics_Skimlinks&amp;amp;LNM=Primary&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; title=&quot;Pentagonal Pouf&quot;&gt;Pentagonal Pouf&lt;/a&gt; was an online only item that I ordered a day or two after &lt;a href=&quot;http://racked.com/tags/missoni-for-target&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; title=&quot;best coverage of the issues Target is having with customer service&quot;&gt;the Target website debacle&lt;/a&gt; went down. My previous experiences with Target home delivery weren&amp;#39;t so great, but this time it worked out. My pouf in the form of an ottoman arrived safe and sound and ensconced in a tyvek ottoman cozy. You can tell it isn&amp;#39;t exactly real Missoni quality, but it will make a great pouf/ottoman/coffee table/dancing platform. It&amp;#39;s chilling in my living room until I get my act together and finish my TV room. When will that be? Soon I hope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been almost two months since I&#39;ve posted. The weather is cooling down which means more time inside to work on projects. I&#39;ll post some house updates very soon!</description>

<description>I spend a lot of time thinking about publishing on mobile phones and tablets and have downloaded and played with many apps that shovel print content to the tablet format. Most magazine to digital apps haven&#39;t been that thrilling. Zinio was one that didn&#39;t excite me all that much. I mean, who really prefers swiping a smudgy iPad screen to flipping through glossy pages? That boredom turned around when I noticed they also sell subscriptions to non-US magazines. I used to occasionally treat myself to UK-based Living Etc but at $10 or so an issue it was a rare pleasure....</description>
<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking about publishing on mobile phones and tablets and have downloaded and played with many apps that shovel print content to the tablet format. Most magazine to digital apps haven&#39;t been that thrilling. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zinio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Zinio&lt;/a&gt; was one that didn&#39;t excite me all that much. I mean, who really prefers swiping a smudgy iPad screen to flipping through glossy pages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That boredom turned around when I noticed they also sell subscriptions to non-US magazines. I used to occasionally treat myself to UK-based &lt;a title=&quot;Living Etc&quot; href=&quot;http://www.livingetc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Living Etc&lt;/a&gt; but at $10 or so an issue it was a rare pleasure. And &lt;a title=&quot;living etc prescription page&quot; href=&quot;http://www.magazinesdirect.com/subscription/livingetc/10162081/livingetc.thtml&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;at $100+&lt;/a&gt; for a print subscription it just wasn&#39;t going to happen. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zinio.com/browse/publications/index.jsp?sch=true&amp;amp;productId=500463130&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;On Zinio I can subscribe for 32 bucks and change&lt;/a&gt;! There&#39;s no long wait for the printed mag to fly over the Atlantic to your home, and, you don&#39;t have to buy into the Apple hype machine and get an iPad -- you can read publications on &lt;a title=&quot;zino readers&quot; href=&quot;http://www.zinio.com/apps/index.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;zinio&#39;s apps for iOS, Android and your desktop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple pages from my favorite story in the August 2011 issue. They are from a lovely townhouse in London. I will eternally be a favorite of the combination of old architecture and white walls with modern decor. Sure I&#39;d prefer to rip these pages out of a magazine and pin them to an inspiration board, but I&#39;m no purist -- a screenshot and &lt;a title=&quot;my pins on pinterest&quot; href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/teruterubouzu/pins/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;pinterest&lt;/a&gt; will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this sounds like an ad, but it isn&#39;t. I just love the magazines this app gives me access to and wanted to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wallpaper Whenever: Festival in the bathroom.</title>

<description>Yeah. I&#39;ve featured this amazing wallpaper before. I originally sourced these Mini Moderns wallpaper samples for my TV room. Then I started thinking it would actually be even more perfect in my bathroom. The geomtric print referencing the 1951 Festival of Britain will add a much needed mid-century element to the room and the yellow and grey will contrast nicely with the blue accent tiles I really wish weren&#39;t there. This project is way down the list, but I&#39;m glad I have the walls sorted out! Featured Wallpaper: Festival by Mini Moderns in Concrete, Stone or Bunting Blue and Red....</description>
