The idea was there are lots of &lt;a href="http://vimcolorschemetest.googlecode.com/svn/html/index-html.html"&gt;interesting dark background color themes&lt;/a&gt; that suffer from decreased color contrast by not being on a black background, so adding a text shadow would make it look better.  I grabbed a very naive and fast "color darkening" algorithm from a &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1787124/programmatically-darken-a-hex-colour"&gt;StackOverflow response&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

But there's this caustic edge to the people there that is pretty shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

He confessed that binary logic, as you'd encode on a circuit board with gates, was a difficult concept to get his head around, and he wondered how much of that was really necessary in "modern" programming.&lt;/p&gt;

While writing it, I made a couple of mistakes that are probably quite common even to people who know JavaScript quite well but have not used it much outside the browser environment.&lt;/p&gt;
