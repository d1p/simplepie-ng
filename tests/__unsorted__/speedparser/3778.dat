  <content type="text/html"><![CDATA[<p>Congress, through the 1947 addition of section 10(j) to the National 
Labor Relations Act, authorized district courts to grant preliminary 
injunctive relief for unfair labor practices if they deem such relief 
&ldquo;just and proper.&rdquo; To this day a circuit split persists over the correct
 interpretation of this &ldquo;just and proper&rdquo; standard. Some circuits 
interpret &ldquo;just and proper&rdquo; to require application of the traditional 
equitable principles approach that normally governs preliminary 
injunctions. Other circuits interpret &ldquo;just and proper&rdquo; to require an 
analysis of whether injunctive relief is necessary to preserve the 
National Labor Relations Board&rsquo;s remedial power. This Note examines the 
justifications behind these two interpretations in light of section 
10(j)&rsquo;s statutory structure&mdash;most notably, the use of the just and proper 
standard in two other provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. It
 also considers the legislative history of section 10(j) and the public policy 
consequences underlying Congress&rsquo;s mandate granting the Board exclusive 
jurisdiction to seek injunctive relief in court under section 10(j). 
This Note argues that an examination of these factors reveals that 
Congress intended for courts to focus their section 10(j) analysis on 
the preservation of the National Labor Relations Board&rsquo;s remedial power 
rather than on traditional equitable principles.</p>]]></content>

  <content type="text/html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit confronted the 
novel question of when moral rights protections vest under the Visual 
Artists Rights Act. In <em>Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art Foundation, Inc. v. B&uuml;chel</em>, the First Circuit determined that the protections of the Visual Artists Rights Act begin when a work is &ldquo;created&rdquo; under the Copyright Act. This Note argues that this decision harms moral rights conceptually and is likely to result in unpredictable and inconsistent decisions. This Note proposes instead that these statutory protections should vest when an artist determines that his work is complete and presents it to the public. This standard is more consistent with the history of moral rights. Additionally, public access is necessary to justify a treatment of art different from that of other types of property, and it is a more essential component of moral rights than an artist&rsquo;s feelings of connection to his work. Finally, the legislative intent behind the Visual Artists Rights Act and the reasoning in previous judicial decisions are more accurately reflected by a public 
disclosure standard. Utilizing &ldquo;creation&rdquo; as a vesting point for moral 
rights is not supported by the history of the Visual Artists Rights Act and will result in uncertainty and inconsistency in future decisions.</p>]]></content>

  <content type="text/html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost everyone acknowledges that stare decisis should play a 
significant role when the Supreme Court of the United States resolves 
constitutional cases. Yet the academic and judicial rationales for this 
practice tend to rely on naked consequentialist considerations, and make
 only passing efforts to square the Court&rsquo;s stare decisis doctrines with
 the language of the Constitution. This Article offers a qualified 
defense of constitutional stare decisis that rests exclusively on 
constitutional text. It aims to broaden the overlapping consensus of 
interpretive theories that can support a role for constitutional stare 
decisis, but to do this it must narrow the circumstances in which stare decisis can be applied.</p>]]></content>

  <content type="text/html"><![CDATA[<p>Modern employment discrimination law is defined by an increasingly 
complex set of frameworks. These frameworks structure the ways that 
courts, juries, and litigants think about discrimination. This Article 
challenges whether courts should use the frameworks to conceptualize 
discrimination. It argues that just as faulty sorting contributes to 
stereotyping and societal discrimination, courts are using faulty 
structures to substantively limit discrimination claims.<br />This Article
 makes three central contributions. First, it demonstrates how 
discrimination analysis has been reduced to a rote sorting process. It recognizes and makes explicit courts' methodology so that the structure 
of discrimination analysis and its effects can be examined. Second, it demonstrates how the frameworks tend to squeeze out claims that are 
arguably cognizable under the federal discrimination statutes' broad 
operative language. This Article's final contribution is to propose a 
simpler model for thinking about employment discrimination law. It 
argues for a return to first principles that would require courts to 
specifically define key statutory language.</p>]]></content>
