				</div>Google+ is yet another foray into the social media market for Google. Although there were previous communities (mainly what Google had bought up), its first attempt was with Google Wave. When Wave first appeared on the scene it gained a lot of people quite quickly but was hampered by performance as conversations got larger and more people joined. Eventually its popularity waned, and what was a unique and interesting concept for social interaction on the web started to die out. 
  Google Buzz was another attempt; one that is still around today and is integrated with Google Mail (and now Google+) was a way of bringing a minimal degree of sharing between contacts. With Buzz you had the option of posting to it with links and/or photos and could even connect other sites to it so any updates from you elsewhere on the web would also get posted to Buzz. 
  Now, with Google+ they&#039;re setting themselves up as a direct competitor to Facebook. This is a comparison that is unavoidable, ever since Facebook became the most well known social media site any that have launched since no matter what their intentions, they have been compared to it. Whist there are a number of similarities between Google+ and Facebook there are also a number of differences (which I&#039;ll come back to shortly). 
  This being a Google project it is fairly obvious the focus will be on information.  Once you&#039;re signed up to use Google+ the &amp;quot;Google bar&amp;quot; (I don&#039;t know it&#039;s official name) changes to include extra options to show the number of notifications you have on Google+ and a link to quickly share &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; with people on Google+. 
  When you share something you can type a message and then, like Buzz, you can attach a link or photo too it, though in this case you can also attach video or your current geo-location. Once shared this then appears in your stream and will be visible to those &amp;quot;circles&amp;quot; that you&#039;ve chosen to allow the post to be seen by. 
  A circle, in Google+ terms, is a collection of people that have been grouped for easy categorization for when you want to communicate with multiple people. By default you have circles for Friends, Family, Acquaintances, and Following; but you can also add your own. To add people to a circle they have quite a nice interface where you visually see circles and thumbnails of people that are available to add/invite to join a circle. When you hover over the circle it expands out show who is in the circle and includes a nicely styled tooltip explaining the circle. To add people to a circle you can either drag and drop them in, or click on a circle and add them by searching for a name or email address. 
  The next new concept for Google+ is a &amp;quot;Spark&amp;quot; - this is a way of displaying news from popular sites based upon your interests. Each spark you add can then be viewed individually from the left-hand navigation and can be used to share posts with your circles. 
  Finally, there are hangouts. A hangout is where multiple people can have video chats using Google Talk - this does however require a plugin to first be installed to allow the use of your webcam and microphone. This currently supports up to 10 people in a single conversation. 
  Overall the design of the interface is nice and is a huge improvement over what Google Wave was. It&#039;s also similar in layout to Facebook which means anyone who has already used Facebook should find using Google+ to be a fairly familiar experience. The user experience when using the mobile application is actually even better though - it takes the familiar elements of Google&#039;s other mobile applications and builds upon them making the interaction feel smoother and easier. 
  When registering it will ask you to join your account with a Picasa account - this is what it will use for sharing your posted images with others. Hopefully there will also be a way of using Flickr, or at least automatically streaming from Flickr in the future. 
  From the point of view of a developer there are several key areas where you could potentially have API access for, and hopefully it won&#039;t be long before Google release an API for it. To some degree it is already possible to post to it due to the use of the Google +1 button but this is only for sending links to posts on other sites.
  Over the coming few weeks as the site grows and evolves I&#039;ll carry on using this new site to see how it compares and to better determine what advantages and disadvantages it has.<p>Continue reading about "Google+" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/905">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>Firefox 5</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->Today was the release of the first Firefox update as part of it&#039;s shortened release cycle. The release of Firefox 5 does highlight what is currently wrong with the browser. 
  Extensions - &amp;nbsp;as you have to specify what versions of the browser the extension is compatible with when you&#039;re creating one a developer will typically go for 4.0.x for example, though this means unless extension developers update their extensions as regular as Firefox (and ahead of the releases) it means that the extensions will disable themselves when you update. Other browsers that use extensions, such as Chrome do not do this - they continue to work without a required update. 
  Installer - whilst Google Chrome silently updates itself, Firefox still requires an installer be run and the browser restarted. There are arguments that Google Chrome doing this is annoying if for example you&#039;re a web developer and need to test on a particular version, but even having an option there for it to be a non-intrusive update would be nice. 
  Performance - the performance has improved quite a bit since Firefox 4, and even more so since Firefox 3.5 - but from a cold boot it is still quicker to launch Google Chrome or even the ancient IE6 (forget IE7+ they have far slower load times). Whilst I put this down as a negative, I am quite pleased with the improvements they have made to the start up time, even JavaScript performance is faster. 
  The features added in Firefox 5 are: 
   
    Added support for CSS animations 
    The Do-Not-Track header preference has been moved to increase discoverability 
    Improved canvas, JavaScript, memory, and networking performance 
    Improved standards support for HTML5, XHR, MathML, SMIL, and canvas 
    Improved spell checking for some locales 
    Improved desktop environment integration for Linux users 
    WebGL content can no longer load cross-domain textures 
    Background tabs have setTimeout and setInterval clamped to 1000ms to improve performance 
    The Firefox development channel switcher introduced in previous Firefox Beta updates has been removed 
   
  Out of these the CSS3 Animations is the most interesting point, and may produce some interesting results. Hopefully we&#039;ll start to see a lot more innovation with Firefox in future releases.<p>Continue reading about "Firefox 5" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/904">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>E3 Day 1, Lion, iOS 5 and the iCloud</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->
It was a big day for announcements, not only was it the start of this years E3, but also WWDC. Whilst the E3 event kicked off with an Xbox keynote featuring demos of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and the great looking new Tomb Raider game, it was announced that all future Tom Clancy titles would feature Kinect support - as will Mass Effect 3. Gears of War 3 was then demonstrated, as was Crytek&#039;s new Kinect supported game - Ryse. A big surprise for me was not the release of a remastered Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition (due out November 15th 2011), but the announcement of Halo 4 (to be released in 2012) being the start of a new trilogy. Peter Molyneux also announced Fable: The Journey would be the first Fable title to support Kinect and will be out in 2012. Plenty of Kinect empowered titles, but the one that may get me to buy a Kinect is the announcement of the Star Wars game for Kinect. It&#039;s been seen previously as a tech demo, but this time it&#039;s an actual game set in the Clone Wars era. Sadly it doesn&#039;t actually look that good, but I&#039;ll have to give a try anyway. 
  On the WWDC side of things Steve Jobs took the stage despite a leave of absence due to health problems and introduced the crowd to the topics of Lion, iOS 5 and &amp;quot;some interesting cloud stuff&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;Out of the 250 new features they report as being in Lion they started with demonstrating 10 of these. To start with they&#039;re making a big deal of multi-touch gestures in Lion. If gestures is enabled you will no longer see the scrollbars - an interesting idea, one which I wonder how effective it will be as in some designs it may not always be obvious there is more to see if the scrollbar isn&#039;t there. 
  Full-screen applications was mentioned at the last Apple event, here they announced that it would be available for more applications. There was also talk of Mission Control, though they didn&#039;t talk of any aspects of it that were not covered at the previous Lion themed event. Strangely the Mac Store also got included as one of the 10 new features for Lion, despite it being available in Snow Leopard - only difference is it will come pre-installed. For all people with Mac Store installed it will be better though - when updating software it will now only download changes rather than the full application every time. 
  Launchpad was again mentioned, the interface that takes it&#039;s inspiration from the iOS interface. There was also more talk of &amp;quot;Resume&amp;quot; a feature that saves the current state of an application, just as the new Auto-save feature will auto-save your work. I&#039;ll be interested to find out what sort of support it has for existing applications - if any. The autosave feature will use deltas to store versions so that it will save space and will also allow you to halt auto-saving and allow easy creation of duplicates. This then follows into the new &amp;quot;Versions&amp;quot; feature which is basically a repository for version controlling your files, but will be easy for all to use whether you&#039;re used to using SVN or not. 
  The next feature was &amp;quot;AirDrop&amp;quot;, an application used for sharing files with other users on your network using it. It uses auto-discovery to see people on your network, but will require confirmation to send and receive files using an encrypted transfer. 
  Finally they demonstrated some big improvements to the Mail.app which now features better searching and rule creation, conversation view - all of which brings it closer to being level with the Google Mail web interface. Also, as previously rumoured, the Lion upgrade will only be available to buy via the Mac Store (and of course with new Macs!) sometime in July for $29.99 and will be a 4Gb download. A single download will also work for all Macs that you&#039;re authorised for meaning you only need to download it once. Apparently it won&#039;t even need a reboot! 
  Moving on to iOS 5 they announced that with selling over 200 million iOS devices they now have a 44% share of the mobile operating system market. With the new iOS 5 upgrade there are over 1,500 new APIs available. First off, notifications have had a bit of an overhaul. To solve the annoyances of notifications not only have they introduced a new notification centre, but the entire system. If you&#039;re using your phone when a new push notification arrives it will slide down at the top of your screen (even if in a full screen app), and if your phone is locked it will display in a great looking list above the slide to unlock part. On the unlock screen and in the notification centre they are all categorised and are easy to remove, read, and use. The notification centre is accessible by swiping downwards from the top of the screen. 
  The second new feature is Newstands - a new application in a similar vein to iBooks, but is aimed at subscription based magazines, etc. that are issue based. A lot of magazine publishers have already signed up for this and popular ones such as National Geographic will be available from launch. Next up is Twitter integration - the iOS settings page will now feature Twitter settings that can be made available via an API to any iOS application. It will also be integrated with Safari, Maps, Photos and Camera including others so that you can tweet straight from the application. It will also be possible to automatically update contacts via Twitter. 
  Safari Reading List seems like Apple&#039;s solution to Instapaper with the ability to save things to read later, and a Safari Reader for reading articles without any distractions. The articles you bookmark in Reading List will also be synchronised with other iOS devices too. Safari will also be changing it&#039;s multiple window view for tabs - hopefully they won&#039;t feel too clumsy on small screens. 
  Reminders is another new feature to use for creating &amp;quot;To Do&amp;quot; lists that will synchronise across devices and with iCal. Each reminder will allow a title, location, &amp;nbsp;and dates. The Reminders can also be based on location so that if you go somewhere it uses the &amp;quot;geofence&amp;quot; feature to determine a reminder is applicable. 
  The camera is getting some improvements too - to start with they have added a camera icon to the lock screen to make it quicker to get to for taking pictures (hopefully it won&#039;t result in many people taking photos in their pockets!) as well as the &amp;quot;volume up&amp;quot; button. The camera will now support an AE/AF lock to help handle exposure of an image, and also has a good pinch to zoom feature complete with bar to show level of zoom. Some minor editing on the phone will now also be possible - crop, rotate, reduce red-eye and a 1-click enhance. 
  Mail for iOS has been updated with Rich text formatting, indentation, flagging, and dragging addresses between To, CC, and BCC fields. The new dictionary API being used with Mail on the iPad actually looks quite good and will show definitions as well. 
  Recently we saw that Windows 8 will feature a split-keyboard option for touch based devices - well so is iOS. In iOS 5 you can scroll up through the keyboard to split the keyboard for easy thumb typing.&amp;nbsp; 
  Inline with the Mac Store change for only transferring changes in updates they will be doing the same with the App Store. In addition to this it will no longer be necessary to own a PC in order to download large applications or to register in iTunes - updates will now be possible over the air. This iTunes synchronisation over Wi-Fi will also allow music to be copied over in the same way. 
  The Game Centre will be getting some updates to it&#039;s social features (including a friends of friends feature), and will allow games to be bought and downloaded directly from it rather than going through the App Store. 
  The messaging functionality on the iPhone has now been renamed to &amp;quot;iMessage&amp;quot; and will expand beyond being SMS and MMS to also supporting videos, contacts, group messaging, and delivery/read receipts. The messages will now also be synchronised so that they will be available on both your iPhone and iPad. Interestingly it will also show if the other user is typing a message - similar to a lot of modern IM applications making this application more like a combination of iChat and SMS. The iChat-like functionality will work over 3G or Wi-Fi. 
  The iOS 5 SDK is available as of today, and will be released to devices in the Autumn and will be compatible with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod Touch (3rd and 4th gen), iPad and iPad2.&amp;nbsp; 
  Finally they discussed the iCloud - &amp;nbsp;it will automatically store your content in the cloud and wirelessly push it to all your devices. Apparently the way this will work is that it will synchronise all content without any interaction required. All the MobileMe applications have been rewritten from scratch to work with iCloud - for example any contacts added on a device will automatically be uploaded to iCloud and will synchronise with your other devices. All mail stored with a @me account will also be synchronised between devices - basically just like using IMAP. 
  As of now MobileMe will cease to exist, and iCloud will be free. It will also be possible to use this to see purchased applications so that they can be downloaded and synchronised on other devices - this is also applicable to purchases within iBooks. This means your entire device is backed up to the cloud and can be easily transferred to another device or restored if need be. Daily backups to the iCloud will be over Wi-Fi only. This is also applicable via &amp;quot;Documents in the Cloud&amp;quot; for Pages, Keynote and Numbers. To complete the iCloud picture it will also be getting it&#039;s own APIs for developers to use. 
   
    Apps can stores documents in iCloud 
    iCloud pushes documents to user&#039;s devices automatically 
    Documents update on all devices when changed on any device  
   
  The iCloud functionality isn&#039;t limited to just iOS devices - it will work on PCs and Macs too! On the photo side of things it will have new photos automatically pushed to other devices using &amp;quot;Photostream&amp;quot;. On the Mac it will be added as a new album in iPhoto (no mention of Aperture, but presumably the same). On the PC it will synchronise to a new Photostream folder in your &amp;quot;Pictures&amp;quot; folder - it will even stream to AppleTV. In the cloud photos will be stored for 30 days, and on devices it will store the last 1,000 photos - only on Macs and PCs will a photo be stored permanently in order to save space where needed. 
  The final iCloud announcement is for iTunes - it will now store your music purchases in the cloud so that it can be automatically downloaded on other devices. This can be done on a track by track basis, or by album and will not be chargeable for redownloading. It&#039;s also possible for new purchases to automatically appear on your other devices without manual intervention. It is limited to 10 devices, but will transfer 256kbps AAC files to ensure good quality. 
  The storage space available for iCloud will be 5Gb but doesn&#039;t include music, apps and books - these are counted separately. The synchronisation does also include non-purchases of music via iTunes Match - assuming the song is available in the iTunes store, but costs $24.99 a year to use. With iTunes Match it will automatically update the songs in your library to 256 kbps AAC DRM-free files, and comparitively doing the same with Amazon or Google would take weeks and would cost around twice as much.<p>Continue reading about "E3 Day 1, Lion, iOS 5 and the iCloud" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/903">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

  <p>Launchpad was again mentioned, the interface that takes it's inspiration from the iOS interface. There was also more talk of &quot;Resume&quot; a feature that saves the current state of an application, just as the new Auto-save feature will auto-save your work. I'll be interested to find out what sort of support it has for existing applications - if any. The autosave feature will use deltas to store versions so that it will save space and will also allow you to halt auto-saving and allow easy creation of duplicates. This then follows into the new &quot;Versions&quot; feature which is basically a repository for version controlling your files, but will be easy for all to use whether you're used to using SVN or not.</p> 
  <p>The next feature was &quot;AirDrop&quot;, an application used for sharing files with other users on your network using it. It uses auto-discovery to see people on your network, but will require confirmation to send and receive files using an encrypted transfer.</p> 
  <p>Finally they demonstrated some big improvements to the Mail.app which now features better searching and rule creation, conversation view - all of which brings it closer to being level with the Google Mail web interface. Also, as previously rumoured, the Lion upgrade will only be available to buy via the Mac Store (and of course with new Macs!) sometime in July for $29.99 and will be a 4Gb download. A single download will also work for all Macs that you're authorised for meaning you only need to download it once. Apparently it won't even need a reboot!</p> 
  <p>Moving on to iOS 5 they announced that with selling over 200 million iOS devices they now have a 44% share of the mobile operating system market. With the new iOS 5 upgrade there are over 1,500 new APIs available. First off, notifications have had a bit of an overhaul. To solve the annoyances of notifications not only have they introduced a new notification centre, but the entire system. If you're using your phone when a new push notification arrives it will slide down at the top of your screen (even if in a full screen app), and if your phone is locked it will display in a great looking list above the slide to unlock part. On the unlock screen and in the notification centre they are all categorised and are easy to remove, read, and use. The notification centre is accessible by swiping downwards from the top of the screen.</p> 
  <p>The second new feature is Newstands - a new application in a similar vein to iBooks, but is aimed at subscription based magazines, etc. that are issue based. A lot of magazine publishers have already signed up for this and popular ones such as National Geographic will be available from launch. Next up is Twitter integration - the iOS settings page will now feature Twitter settings that can be made available via an API to any iOS application. It will also be integrated with Safari, Maps, Photos and Camera including others so that you can tweet straight from the application. It will also be possible to automatically update contacts via Twitter.</p> 
  <p>Safari Reading List seems like Apple's solution to Instapaper with the ability to save things to read later, and a Safari Reader for reading articles without any distractions. The articles you bookmark in Reading List will also be synchronised with other iOS devices too. Safari will also be changing it's multiple window view for tabs - hopefully they won't feel too clumsy on small screens.</p> 
  <p>Reminders is another new feature to use for creating &quot;To Do&quot; lists that will synchronise across devices and with iCal. Each reminder will allow a title, location, &nbsp;and dates. The Reminders can also be based on location so that if you go somewhere it uses the &quot;geofence&quot; feature to determine a reminder is applicable.</p> 
  <p>The camera is getting some improvements too - to start with they have added a camera icon to the lock screen to make it quicker to get to for taking pictures (hopefully it won't result in many people taking photos in their pockets!) as well as the &quot;volume up&quot; button. The camera will now support an AE/AF lock to help handle exposure of an image, and also has a good pinch to zoom feature complete with bar to show level of zoom. Some minor editing on the phone will now also be possible - crop, rotate, reduce red-eye and a 1-click enhance.</p> 
  <p>Mail for iOS has been updated with Rich text formatting, indentation, flagging, and dragging addresses between To, CC, and BCC fields. The new dictionary API being used with Mail on the iPad actually looks quite good and will show definitions as well.</p> 
  <p>Recently we saw that Windows 8 will feature a split-keyboard option for touch based devices - well so is iOS. In iOS 5 you can scroll up through the keyboard to split the keyboard for easy thumb typing.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Inline with the Mac Store change for only transferring changes in updates they will be doing the same with the App Store. In addition to this it will no longer be necessary to own a PC in order to download large applications or to register in iTunes - updates will now be possible over the air. This iTunes synchronisation over Wi-Fi will also allow music to be copied over in the same way.</p> 
  <p>The Game Centre will be getting some updates to it's social features (including a friends of friends feature), and will allow games to be bought and downloaded directly from it rather than going through the App Store.</p> 
  <p>The messaging functionality on the iPhone has now been renamed to &quot;iMessage&quot; and will expand beyond being SMS and MMS to also supporting videos, contacts, group messaging, and delivery/read receipts. The messages will now also be synchronised so that they will be available on both your iPhone and iPad. Interestingly it will also show if the other user is typing a message - similar to a lot of modern IM applications making this application more like a combination of iChat and SMS. The iChat-like functionality will work over 3G or Wi-Fi.</p> 
  <p>The iOS 5 SDK is available as of today, and will be released to devices in the Autumn and will be compatible with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod Touch (3rd and 4th gen), iPad and iPad2.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Finally they discussed the iCloud - &nbsp;it will automatically store your content in the cloud and wirelessly push it to all your devices. Apparently the way this will work is that it will synchronise all content without any interaction required. All the MobileMe applications have been rewritten from scratch to work with iCloud - for example any contacts added on a device will automatically be uploaded to iCloud and will synchronise with your other devices. All mail stored with a @me account will also be synchronised between devices - basically just like using IMAP.</p> 
  <p>As of now MobileMe will cease to exist, and iCloud will be free. It will also be possible to use this to see purchased applications so that they can be downloaded and synchronised on other devices - this is also applicable to purchases within iBooks. This means your entire device is backed up to the cloud and can be easily transferred to another device or restored if need be. Daily backups to the iCloud will be over Wi-Fi only. This is also applicable via &quot;Documents in the Cloud&quot; for Pages, Keynote and Numbers. To complete the iCloud picture it will also be getting it's own APIs for developers to use.</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Apps can stores documents in iCloud</li> 
    <li>iCloud pushes documents to user's devices automatically</li> 
    <li>Documents update on all devices when changed on any device </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The iCloud functionality isn't limited to just iOS devices - it will work on PCs and Macs too! On the photo side of things it will have new photos automatically pushed to other devices using &quot;Photostream&quot;. On the Mac it will be added as a new album in iPhoto (no mention of Aperture, but presumably the same). On the PC it will synchronise to a new Photostream folder in your &quot;Pictures&quot; folder - it will even stream to AppleTV. In the cloud photos will be stored for 30 days, and on devices it will store the last 1,000 photos - only on Macs and PCs will a photo be stored permanently in order to save space where needed.</p> 
  <p>The final iCloud announcement is for iTunes - it will now store your music purchases in the cloud so that it can be automatically downloaded on other devices. This can be done on a track by track basis, or by album and will not be chargeable for redownloading. It's also possible for new purchases to automatically appear on your other devices without manual intervention. It is limited to 10 devices, but will transfer 256kbps AAC files to ensure good quality.</p> 
  <p>The storage space available for iCloud will be 5Gb but doesn't include music, apps and books - these are counted separately. The synchronisation does also include non-purchases of music via iTunes Match - assuming the song is available in the iTunes store, but costs $24.99 a year to use. With iTunes Match it will automatically update the songs in your library to 256 kbps AAC DRM-free files, and comparitively doing the same with Amazon or Google would take weeks and would cost around twice as much.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewEarthOnline/NewsAndArticles/~4/--ShwP1Nx0s" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

			<title>Apple iPad (2nd Gen)</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" --> On March 2nd Apple, with Steve Jobs in attendance, held an event to announce the release of the iPad 2. As always they started off with the normal statistics that would show Apple to be better than everyone else - so the usual type of marketing really. Apparently they have so far sold 100 million books via iBooks and with Random House now joining them it will add a catalogue of 17, 000 more books to choose from. After having sold nearly 15 million iPads in 2010 (April to December) and amassing more than 90% of the market share it&#039;s obvious that whatever they did with their latest release they&#039;d have to stay ahead of the competition and continue pleasing consumers. 
  The new iPad 2 uses the A5 dual-core processor and is up to 2x faster than the old one. It has a front and rear camera, a gyroscope, and is actually a third thinner than it&#039;s predecessor now measuring only 8mm. This means the iPad 2 is actually thinner with than the iPhone 4, and unlike the iPhone 4 will ship in white straight away with support for both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon in the US. The battery life is apparently the same as it was before with it being estimated to last 10 hours, and costs the same as the previous model also. 
   iPad 2 Pricing 
     
       
          
        16Gb 
        32Gb 
        64Gb 
       
     
     
       
        Wi-Fi only 
        $499 
        $599 
        $699 
       
       
        Wi-Fi + 3G 
        $629 
        $729 
        $829 
       
     
   
  This new model will be shipped in the US on March 11th, and other countries on March 25th (including the UK). At this time it will be running iOS 4.3 which includes PhotoBooth, improved performance in Safari, and other improvements. This will also bring Personal Hotspot to the iPhone 4, and FaceTime to the iPad. Existing devices will also get the iOS 4.3 upgrade on March 11th.
  At the launch there will also be a special new cover designed for the iPad 2 which attaches magnetically, and has a microfibre covering to help keep the screen clean. The iPad will turn on when the cover is removed, and turn off when it is put back on.&amp;nbsp; 
  New to the iPad 2 is iMovie with precision editor, multi-track audio recording, 3 new themes, AirPlay to Apple TV, HD video sharing, and is a Universal App so this new version will work with your iPhone 4 also. This new Universal app will be $4.99 and will be available at launch. 
  Garage Band will also be making it to the iPad with touch instruments (grand piano, organ, guitars, drums, and bass), guitar amps and effects, 8 track recording and mixing, 250+ loops, AAC emailing of your song, and is compatible with the Mac OS X version. This will also be available March 11th for $4.99.
  Sadly no iPad 2 version of iPhoto was announced.&amp;nbsp;<p>Continue reading about "Apple iPad (2nd Gen)" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/898">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>Introducing Fauna.me</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->
				<div style="float:right; margin-left:10px; padding:5px; border:1px solid #eee;">
					<img src="http://www.newearthonline.co.uk/images/custom/linnaeus_pro_icon.png" alt="Icon for Linnaeus Pro for iPhone application" title="Icon for Linnaeus Pro for iPhone application" width="200" height="200" />
				</div>
Almost two years after starting work on an iPhone application for recording wildlife I&#039;ve finally released a Beta - but not of the application it started off as. 
  Linnaeus was going to be released in Pro and Lite versions for the iPhone with some hope that I&#039;d also do a version for the Blackberry. Just as I was about to release Linnaeus Lite to Beta testers I found that the species and taxonomy data I had compiled took so much space I was having trouble getting it to be included in the package. As a result the data was put on my webserver with the intention of getting the iPhone application to use this instead, however whilst testing the data I started using my Fauna.me domain as a place for testing query performance to make sure that getting an iPhone application to connect to it was going to be feasible. As a result the test became more and more detailed until it was on the verge of becoming a website, thus the Fauna.me website was born. 
  To tie in with the site being created on the fauna.me domain I have also changed the name of the application to match the domain name. Fauna.me is now available for people to start registering on and will allow people to add their sightings to a map. The details each sighting can store are: 
   
    Species name (can be found using a search), 
    Trip (a user can group sightings into trips), 
    Country the sighting was made in, 
    Location - a friendly place name such as a city or park, 
    Latitude and longitude, 
    Notes about the sighting, 
    The number of sightings made at that time, 
    and the date / time the sighting was made. 
   
  The majority of this information is private to the user, but each sighting is used anonymously with the country details to show species distributions on the map. This map can be viewed by anyone whether they&#039;re registered or not. By not having the specific location of endangered species on the map it helps protect them against poachers knowing their whereabouts whilst also helping the conservation community know a general location of where a species has been sighted. The data is used anonymously to protect the user&#039;s privacy and uses no no information other than &amp;quot;country&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;species name&amp;quot; - nothing can be linked to the user. 
  If you&#039;re a keen spotter of wildlife then you can also use the &amp;quot;life list&amp;quot; feature to see a list of each species you have seen without them being tied to a particular trip. By navigating or searching for species whilst logged in it will also provide a list of your sightings with each species record. 
  Whilst not yet available, the Fauna.me application will soon expand to include a &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; feature so you can share your sightings with people you know; but you can already start posting links to species easily on Facebook and Twitter using the social networking links. If you&#039;re a photographer then feel free to also post photos in the Flickr group (at the time of writing we have 55 members and 803 photos), and let me know if you&#039;re willing to have your photos included on different species pages. 
  It is also planned that this will make it&#039;s way onto mobile platforms shortly.

As a result the data was put on my webserver with the intention of getting the iPhone application to use this instead, however whilst testing the data I started using my <a href="http://fauna.me" title="Record your wildlife sightings online" class="ext_link">Fauna.me</a> domain as a place for testing query performance to make sure that getting an iPhone application to connect to it was going to be feasible. As a result the test became more and more detailed until it was on the verge of becoming a website, thus the Fauna.me website was born.</p> 
  <p>To tie in with the site being created on the fauna.me domain I have also changed the name of the application to match the domain name. Fauna.me is now available for people to start registering on and will allow people to add their sightings to a map. The details each sighting can store are:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Species name (can be found using a search),</li> 
    <li>Trip (a user can group sightings into trips),</li> 
    <li>Country the sighting was made in,</li> 
    <li>Location - a friendly place name such as a city or park,<br /></li> 
    <li>Latitude and longitude,</li> 
    <li>Notes about the sighting,</li> 
    <li>The number of sightings made at that time,</li> 
    <li>and the date / time the sighting was made.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The majority of this information is private to the user, but each sighting is used anonymously with the country details to show species distributions on the map. This map can be viewed by anyone whether they're registered or not. By not having the specific location of endangered species on the map it helps protect them against poachers knowing their whereabouts whilst also helping the conservation community know a general location of where a species has been sighted. The data is used anonymously to protect the user's privacy and uses no no information other than &quot;country&quot; and &quot;species name&quot; - nothing can be linked to the user.</p> 
  <p>If you're a keen spotter of wildlife then you can also use the &quot;life list&quot; feature to see a list of each species you have seen without them being tied to a particular trip. By navigating or searching for species whilst logged in it will also provide a list of your sightings with each species record.</p> 
  <p>Whilst not yet available, the Fauna.me application will soon expand to include a &quot;friends&quot; feature so you can share your sightings with people you know; but you can already start posting links to species easily on Facebook and Twitter using the social networking links. If you're a photographer then feel free to also post photos in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/linnaeus/" title="Join the Flickr group!" class="ext_link">Flickr group</a> (at the time of writing we have 55 members and 803 photos), and let me know if you're willing to have your photos included on different species pages.</p> 
  <p>It is also planned that this will make it's way onto mobile platforms shortly.</p>

			<title>HTML5 Video is broken...</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->

				</div>... or is it? I don&#039;t mean to be harsh, but as it currently stands it is true and likely the reason why Adobe Flash will not die just yet. 
   Historically, with the various methods of using the embed and object tags there was always the problem that the codec used with uploaded videos was dependent on the end-user having that codec installed. The biggest issue though was that different browsers required different code in order for the video to be embedded and playable. People eventually solved this by using a video player built in Flash to play videos - a method popularised by YouTube. To make this easier for the end user there would also be video encoding done behind the scenes to standardise the format used so it could be played by the Flash player. 
  Now flashing forward to HTML 5 we saw the addition of the video tag which promised to help solve this and it looked like it may have been the final nail in the coffin for Adobe Flash (after already being categorically refused from being supported by iOS devices). To further cement this we saw Google use the H.264 codec in a HTML 5 beta of YouTube and support for it was added to Google Chrome. 
  Between then and today though they started work on their own video standard and instead of adding support for that alongside H.264 they are in fact going to be phasing out support for H.264 from their browser. So that&#039;s it, Google are ditching H.264 and are replacing it with WebM. So what this means is that the codec which was most widely used (it&#039;s also used in other applications) is now going to be ditched leaving web developers with the same problem that drove them to Flash in the first place. 
   
    We expect even more rapid innovation in the web media platform in the coming year and are focusing our investments in those technologies that are developed and licensed based on open web principles. To that end, we are changing Chrome&#039;s HTML5 &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; support to make it consistent with the codecs already supported by the open Chromium project. Specifically, we are supporting the WebM (VP8) and Theora video codecs, and will consider adding support for other high-quality open codecs in the future. Though H.264 plays an important role in video, as our goal is to enable open innovation, support for the codec will be removed and our resources directed towards completely open codec technologies. 
   
  So the landscape is now going to be that IE9 will support H.264 and no other codec, but Chrome and upcoming revisions of other browsers will add support for WebM. So is it fair to see HTML5 video is broken? Upon reflection and thinking about the situation in more detail probably not. Unless Microsoft feel pressured to add WebM support to IE9 it will be necessary for web developers to have a solution of how to keep their videos cross-browser. This could mean having videos uploaded as both H.264 and WebM and switching between the file extension using JavaScript for example depending on the browser used.<p>Continue reading about "HTML5 Video is broken..." on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/895">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>Hidden.app</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->There are quite a few anti-theft solutions out there for many types of devices and there have been many success stories from people using the one that&#039;s part of MobileMe to locate iPhone thieves. In the case of Macbooks they&#039;re probably a little more desirable and tend to be worth a bit more but there hasn&#039;t really been anything on par with what MobileMe gives iOS devices. 
  That is until Hidden.app; a similar solution which will help you locate your OS X based device should it be stolen. Over the Christmas period it had an introductory special offer at a reduced price which has helped to gather a lot of attention to this new application/service but even now it&#039;s only $10 so it&#039;s still not a bad price! 
   
    When you activate tracking, Hidden will locate your stolen computer anywhere on the planet, collect photos of the thief and screen shots of the computer in use. (We also collect lots of nerdy network information, but we won&rsquo;t bore you with the details!) 
   
  Once you&#039;ve bought the software you will be asked to register your device during the installation process and this will add your device to the Hidden.app website (you can change the name of the device once you&#039;re signed in there). After restarting your Mac the application will be more or less invisible (you could always view the process list from the bash prompt) and will be ready for use. In the online interface you&#039;re then able to put your device into test mode, or state that it is stolen and it will begin to gather network information, screenshots and image captures from the built-in iSight if it&#039;s a Macbook or Macbook Pro. With the network information it gathers it is then able to pinpoint the location of your Macbook on a map. It is however possible to fool this but viewing the full network information will help to identify when this is the case. 
  Remember though, this only works if it has an internet connection and doesn&#039;t stop people stealing it in the first place so it is recommended that it is used in conjunction with other security measures if necessary.<p>Continue reading about "Hidden.app" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/894">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>blueSLR</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->Although photography is one of my favourite hobbies (with the exception of the previous post) it&#039;s not something that makes it way onto my main blog often as I like to keep it&#039;s focus on web development and design (with some geek reviews too). As this one is about an iPhone application I decided there was enough overlap with the normal topics to warrant a post. 
  At night or when photographing wildlife it can be quite useful to have a remote release for your camera, such as the RC-1 for the Canon cameras. Though this does mean carrying extra equipment and spare batteries with you, so if you were able to somehow use your phone it would be more ideal as it&#039;s something you&#039;re bound to carry around with you anyway. This is what blueSLR does - it uses the iPhone as a remote release for your camera by allowing control over bluetooth (which requires an adapter for your camera). 
  At present it only supports 11 Nikon models (between 3 different adapters) on the iPhone but they plan on adding Canon cameras and Android / Blackberry support soon. Personally I can&#039;t wait for support to be added for the Canon EOS 5D mkII because it according to reviews I&#039;ve read elsewhere it also adds the ability to geotag your photographs by adding GPS information from your mobile phone. 
  At the time of writing the following models are supported: 
    
   
    Nikon D3100 
    Nikon D5000 
    Nikon D90 
    Nikon D2Xx 
    Nikon D3

			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->

					<img src="http://www.newearthonline.co.uk/images/custom/lenshero.jpg" alt="lenshero" title="lenshero" width="250" height="167" />
				</div>Next year I&#039;ll be making my way to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands for two weeks. As I&#039;m sure you know the Galapagos Islands were made famous by Charles Darwin, naturalist author of &amp;quot;The Origin of the Species&amp;quot;, and are host to a wide variety of species of animals not seen anywhere else in the world. A trip like this is often a once in a lifetime opportunity and so decided that I would have to make sure I take the right camera equipment with me. 
  To start with I replaced my old EOS 300D from previous trips with a shiny new EOS 5D mkII and a 28-135mm IS lens so I could take pictures at a higher resolution. This now left me with decisions to make on whether I would need any other lenses, and what lenses they should be. A lot of the wildlife of note on the Galapagos Islands is large enough to take photos of from a good range so I knew a decent telephoto lens would also be required. I already have a 75-300mm lens but felt that something with greater range would be better. This is where the new lenshero website becomes one of the most useful tools in a photographers arsenal when looking for a new lens. Before looking at the site I had already been looking around and felt certain the lens I should get was a Tamron 200-500mm. Now what lenshero does is allow you to search for lens based upon your needs, price range and current camera as well as a normal keyword search. So searching for &amp;quot;Canon 500mm&amp;quot; comes up with a number of options from Canon, Sigma and Tamron. Out of the six matches I could instantly rule out the prime lenses as I knew I didn&#039;t want one of those at this time. 
  Distinguishing the different lenses in the different results is nice and easy due to it displaying the basic technical information such as &amp;quot;Di LD IF&amp;quot; on the Tamron lens. So going with the 200-500mm Tamron lens first it displayed an approximate price, rating and comments from B&amp;amp;H Photo Video followed by details about the angle and focal length on different types of camera. Whilst the comments and pricing isn&#039;t particularly useful due to it being limited to one source, it is helpful that it lists the pros and cons of the lens, basic specification details and a discussion area for people interested in the lens. 
  Going back to the search and looking at the Sigma 150mm-500mm lens it then gave me the chance to make comparisons easier so I could decide between this Sigma one and the previous Tamron lens. If it hadn&#039;t been for the breakdown that lenshero provides I probably wouldn&#039;t have realised that the Sigma lens takes filters 86mm, is silent, and has image stablisation. These simple things actually made all the difference in choosing a lens and it had changed my mind into getting another Sigma lens instead. 
  When the time comes for me to buy a Tamron 90mm lens I will have to try lenshero again to see if there are any other alternatives which are better at that range. Maybe if by then they have added more sources for pricing and reviews (such as what InvisibleHand does) it will be an even better user experience than it already is.<p>Continue reading about "lenshero" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/892">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

Maybe if by then they have added more sources for pricing and reviews (such as what InvisibleHand does) it will be an even better user experience than it already is.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewEarthOnline/NewsAndArticles/~4/FMBiNZzNjoU" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

				</div>The developers of the forum software phpBB have released a critical update that fixes numerous issues including a vulnerability in the CAPTCHA implementation. The most important part of the update however is to fix an XSS vulnerability on boards that allow Flash to be embedded using BBCode. 
   
    On WebKit based browsers like Safari or Chrome, as well as
Opera, the flash BBCode can be used to execute JavaScript causing a cross site scripting vulnerability. 
   
  The fix they detail for 3.0.7 users is to go to line 354 of includes/message_parser.php and to add the following code: 
  $in = str_replace(&#039; &#039;, &#039;%20&#039;, $in);
// Make sure $in is a URL.
if (!preg_match(&#039;#^&#039; . get_preg_expression(&#039;url&#039;) . &#039;$#i&#039;, $in) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
    !preg_match(&#039;#^&#039; . get_preg_expression(&#039;www_url&#039;) . &#039;$#i&#039;, $in))

} 
  immediately before: 
  // Apply the same size checks on flash files as on images 
  As this is not a retroactive fix it will require owners of phpBB forums to scan previous posts for any that may be affected by this. In order to help with this task they have provided a handy script for uploading to your server which when run will display affected posts.<p>Continue reading about "phpBB v3.0.8" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/890">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>Facebook Mail</title>

				</div>There have been rumours about Project Titan since around February 2010, but today Facebook have unveiled their own email system which according to TechCrunch they have spoken of internally as being a Gmail killer. Now I&#039;m sure Facebook would like to think they can beat Gmail, but even with the saturation of their current user base they may struggle to compete considering many people who have a Google Accounts email for work are likely to have at least one Gmail account for personal use as well. Also, it would have to have some pretty killer features in order to beat what Gmail provides. 
  Mark Zuckerberg at a press conference in San Francisco has spoken of how it provides seamless integration across all the different ways people communicate&amp;quot;. What he tried to make clear was that this was not an email service, at least not an ordinary one at any rate. What this does is it links Facebook chat, social events from your timeline, and text messages in one interface. All people who use this service will be able to get their own @facebook.com email addresses. He also made a point of saying that this service is not an email killer (obviously referring to previous comments regarding Gmail) as email is only part of the service. 
   
    We are also providing an @facebook.com email address to every person on Facebook who wants one. Now people can share with friends over email, whether they&#039;re on Facebook or not. To be clear, Messages is not email. There are no subject lines, no cc, no bcc, and you can send a message by hitting the Enter key. We modeled it more closely to chat and reduced the number of things you need to do to send a message. We wanted to make this more like a conversation. 
   
  So what this basically means is that it&#039;s not email, it&#039;s actually just a form of offline messaging similar to what is available with most IM mediums.&amp;nbsp; 
  Many people on Twitter have commented that they would not trust Facebook with their email, and I do understand where these concerns are coming from. Considering Facebook&#039;s history of having serious privacy issues it&#039;s fair to assume that these concerns are also going to expand into this new service. This being said, I think I will at least try out this new service when it is launched.<p>Continue reading about "Facebook Mail" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/889">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>Adobe HTML5 Video Player widget</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->Just days after it is revealed the new Apple MacBook Air doesn&#039;t include Adobe Flash initially, Adobe unveil their HTML 5 video player widget which is available via their widget browser. 
  
    However, the limited browser support for the HTML5 &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; tag has forced web designers to scramble for a solution that would work across platforms as well as browsers.  To help customers overcome these challenges, Adobe has released an easy-to-use, totally CSS-customizable solution that shifts gracefully from the HTML5 &amp;lt;video&amp;gt; tag to the Flash Player when the tag is not supported. The shift takes place regardless of the screen&mdash;from phone to monitor to TV.
   
  The widget is based on the Kaltura open source library and reportedly works in unspecified versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome. To download this widget you have to either have Dreamweaver CS (which they seem to think most people should) or use their AIR powered widget browser. Either way they force you to install some Adobe software before you can use their HTML 5 widget.<p>Continue reading about "Adobe HTML5 Video Player widget" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/888">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>The (Lion) King of Operating Systems</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->
				<div style="float:right; margin-left:10px; padding:5px; border:1px solid #eee;">
					<img src="http://www.newearthonline.co.uk/images/custom/apple.png" alt="Apple Computers,. The maker of Macs." title="Apple Computers,. The maker of Macs." width="96" height="110" />
				</div>
Apple&#039;s &amp;quot;Back to Mac&amp;quot; event kicked off with the normal statistics showing how well their products have done - it&#039;s something you always expect from their marketing team.&amp;nbsp;Amazingly it is only 33% of their revenue for the past year that came from the Mac. What is even more surprising was them giving Microsoft a pat on the back for their work on the latest version of Office for Mac. Another interesting fact is that they are #1 for consumer satisfaction by ACSI for 7 years in a row, #1 in Consumer reports for the past decade and #1 from PCWorld for reliability. 
  So, moving on to their announcements the started with announcing the release of iLife 11 with new iPhoto, iMovie and Garageband (iDVD and iWeb were there but not mentioned). The three applications now all support full-screen views (which they revealed more about later) but have only minor changes to them. iLife 11 features new book making options, new sharing options and new slide shows. iMovie has added a few features such as instant replay, &amp;quot;movie trailers&amp;quot;, and new sharing options including the ability to send to Vimeo. The movie trailers feature includes movie studio logos (surprised there aren&#039;t any legal issues with this), a new project view, and music tracks performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. Garageband 11 has new features to help fix tracks, new training videos, and a &amp;quot;How did I do&amp;quot; feature for seeing how well you&#039;re learning to play the guitar or keyboard.
  FaceTime has also been released as a Beta for the Mac and will work seamless with iPhone 4 and the latest range of iPod Touch devices. I&#039;ve downloaded and tried it, but it&#039;s nothing special really and by not releasing it for Windows as well it&#039;s not as versatile as Skype.&amp;nbsp; 
  The event, &amp;quot;Back to Mac&amp;quot;, referred to how features from iOS are going to be finding their way back into OS X for version 10.7, titled &amp;quot;Lion&amp;quot;. This new version will have &amp;quot;many features&amp;quot; but they&#039;ve not yet all been announced. The main focus of the announcement was: 
    
   
    Multi-touch gestures, 
    App Store, 
    Full screen applications, 
    Application home screens, 
    Auto-save, 
    Resume application on load. 
   
  The App Store for the Mac will have free and paid for apps where developers get a 70/30 split. Probably the best feature for App Store is the ability to update all the applications (downloaded from the App Store) on your Mac to the latest versions. To easily see these applications you now have the &amp;quot;launch pad&amp;quot; which is the application home screen in OS X Lion. The paging for Launchpad is pretty much the same as on iOS and support multi-touch gestures and folders. 
  The dashboard has now moved and can be accessed by swiping to the left, similar to accessing the search page on iOS - with these changes Dashboard, Spaces and Fullscreen are now a unified feature they call &amp;quot;Mission control&amp;quot; (which is basically Expose). The expose view did look a little clumsy to operate using multi-touch gestures and at one point the demonstrator even had slight problems using it. 
  Their current plan is to release OS X Lion in the Summer of 2011 with more features being revealed over the coming months. The App Store will open in 90 days, but developers will be able to submit applications as of November. 
  Their &amp;quot;one more thing&amp;quot; was a new Macbook Air which resembled some photos leaked recently - it&#039;s small, light weight and features &amp;quot;instant on&amp;quot;, a SSD for storage, and 30-day standby time.<p>Continue reading about "The (Lion) King of Operating Systems" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/887">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

  <p>FaceTime has also been released as a Beta for the Mac and will work seamless with iPhone 4 and the latest range of iPod Touch devices. I've downloaded and tried it, but it's nothing special really and by not releasing it for Windows as well it's not as versatile as Skype.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>The event, &quot;Back to Mac&quot;, referred to how features from iOS are going to be finding their way back into OS X for version 10.7, titled &quot;Lion&quot;. This new version will have &quot;many features&quot; but they've not yet all been announced. The main focus of the announcement was:</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Multi-touch gestures,</li> 
    <li>App Store,</li> 
    <li>Full screen applications,<br /></li> 
    <li>Application home screens,</li> 
    <li>Auto-save,</li> 
    <li>Resume application on load.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The App Store for the Mac will have free and paid for apps where developers get a 70/30 split. Probably the best feature for App Store is the ability to update all the applications (downloaded from the App Store) on your Mac to the latest versions. To easily see these applications you now have the &quot;launch pad&quot; which is the application home screen in OS X Lion. The paging for Launchpad is pretty much the same as on iOS and support multi-touch gestures and folders.</p> 
  <p>The dashboard has now moved and can be accessed by swiping to the left, similar to accessing the search page on iOS - with these changes Dashboard, Spaces and Fullscreen are now a unified feature they call &quot;Mission control&quot; (which is basically Expose). The expose view did look a little clumsy to operate using multi-touch gestures and at one point the demonstrator even had slight problems using it.</p> 
  <p>Their current plan is to release OS X Lion in the Summer of 2011 with more features being revealed over the coming months. The App Store will open in 90 days, but developers will be able to submit applications as of November.</p> 
  <p>Their &quot;one more thing&quot; was a new Macbook Air which resembled some photos leaked recently - it's small, light weight and features &quot;instant on&quot;, a SSD for storage, and 30-day standby time.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NewEarthOnline/NewsAndArticles/~4/kMRQ1f5a7iU" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

					<img src="http://www.newearthonline.co.uk/images/custom/jquery.jpg" alt="jQuery Framework" title="jQuery Framework" width="180" height="64" />
				</div>jQuery is one of those frameworks that has a tremendous following but it is a pretty sizeable framework. Obviously this has it&#039;s downsides when doing mobile development as the capabilities between desktop and mobile do differ somewhat. To some degree you can control what gets included in the jQuery file but there was never a predefined set aimed specifically at mobile devices. 
  The developers of jQuery first branched into jQuery UI for performing JavaScript based UI controls and animations in a similar way to what Scriptaculous is for Prototype. Now the developers have moved on to the next logical step and have developed a mobile version of their framework. At the time of writing it&#039;s not yet been released but it does sound promising and I can&#039;t wait to try it.&amp;nbsp; 
   
    Not only is the core jQuery library being improved to work across all of the major mobile platforms, but we&rsquo;re also working to release a complete, unified, mobile UI framework. 
   
  They&#039;re also quite keen on getting it to be compatible with as many mobile platforms as they can and covering as many different mobile browsers and versions as well. To demonstrate what the mobile framework should work with they have produced a table of compatibility showing graded browser support. The supported mobile platforms are:
  
    
      iOS
      Blackberry OS
      Windows Phone
      Android
      Bada
      Symbian
      WebOS
      Maemo
      MeeGo
    
    Typically it&#039;s not just a single version being supported either, they are considering multiple OS versions and multiple browsers for each platform to try and cover as many combinations as possible. Hopefully it won&#039;t be long until I get to try some of these unified UI elements.

			<title>ITV versus iTV</title>

				</div>There have been rumours that Apple plan to refresh their Apple TV box for some time, possibly close to a year. In the past week or two rumours have started to fly that the refresh is going to happen soon and that it will mean a name change too - it will be rebranded as the Apple iTV.
  When I first heard this news I thought it may cause a few branding issues in the UK due to ITV being the name of a channel. Way ahead of me the lawyers for ITV seem to be investigating whether this is going to happen and whether they&#039;ll have a case to take Apple to court over it. I think there&#039;s a pretty good chance that if the name change does happen that ITV will be in with a strong case to protect it&#039;s name which may mean either a name change for the UK market or Apple having to license the name from them.&amp;nbsp;<p>Continue reading about "ITV versus iTV" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/883">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>Xcode 4</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<!-- ckey="48FB8288" -->
				<div style="float:right; margin-left:10px; padding:5px; border:1px solid #eee;">
					<img src="http://www.newearthonline.co.uk/images/custom/xcode.jpg" alt="Apple Xcode" title="Apple Xcode" width="200" height="200" />
				</div>I do like doing iOS development, but I have always found the interface for doing so to be a little cumbersome and long winded. First you write your code in Xcode and then design your interfaces in Interface Builder - when writing PHP I wouldn&#039;t use two apps to split out parts of the MVC like that; I&#039;d just use Textwrangler or other such text editor. This is why it&#039;s always seemed odd that Apple would split development of an application out into different applications. 
  Apple have released a preview (now onto it&#039;s second iteration) of Xcode 4 - a brand new interface for Cocoa development that seeks to unify them into a single application and have advertised it as being intelligent enough to help you write better code. 
   
    The Xcode IDE understands your project&rsquo;s every detail, identifies mistakes in both syntax and logic, and will even fix your code for you. Quite simply, Xcode 4 will help you write better code. 
   
  Whilst code checking and auto-suggesting fixes is an interesting topic (maybe one for another article) what interests me (in addition to the unification of the two applications) is that they&#039;ve worked on clearing up a lot of clutter so there is now jump navigation and small icons for switching between the different views. It might not sound like much but I often find when coding that the more space you have to read through code, the better. It&#039;s also quite handy that you can now drag and drop controls onto code to wire them up to use that function or variable. 
   
    With the new Xcode Assistant, the two-pane editor layout in Xcode 4 becomes dramatically more powerful. When you turn on Assistant, the IDE will anticipate which other files you need to see, as you work. 
   
  The purpose of such a feature is that it will show you the code for headers if you&#039;re working on implementing the class, or show you the parent class definition if you&#039;re working in a class that inherits from it. Simple, but a great idea. They&#039;ve also tightly integrated version control with Xcode 4 so that you can easily switch between and view differences between versions of the code. There are some seriously basic and/or ugly diff tools out there (such as UltraCompare on the PC) and this isn&#039;t one of them - it is actually more powerful than the code comparison in Text Wrangler and looks a lot prettier too.
  I actually can&#039;t wait for Xcode 4 to reach the final release.&amp;nbsp;<p>Continue reading about "Xcode 4" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/880">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

				</div>When the Digital Economy Act was pushed through Parliament at breakneck speeds before the Government Election this year it caused a massive outburst from the tech community due to the lack of thought and detail in the proposed plan. When it also passed the House of Lords and was brought into law many people gave up hope that the Act may be changed. 
  When this law comes into effect it will mean massive changes for ISPs as they comply with the new law, but it seems it&#039;s not just the public who are unhappy with the law - BT and TalkTalk are seeking a judicial review of the Act due to questions over it&#039;s legality. 
  
    Both think it had &amp;quot;insufficient scrutiny&amp;quot; and question whether its proposals to curb illegal file-sharing harm &amp;quot;basic rights and freedoms&amp;quot;.

  Not only are they concerned that the law could make people move to smaller ISPs where they don&#039;t have the resources to check everyone&#039;s activity, but also that it may conflict with the EU legislation that ISPs are not responsible for what their connections are used for.
  As I&#039;ve said before, the majority of the Act is fine but they really do need to put more thought and detail into some of the more controversial elements of it. It wouldn&#039;t help if they got some &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; experience behind the Act so that they would better understand what it would mean. However as the Government have closed the Twitter account for Digital Britain it suggests they have no intention of reviewing Act.<p>Continue reading about "BT and TalkTalk challenge Digital Economy Act" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/879">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>Firefox 4 Beta</title>

I&#039;m a bit late reporting this one, but Mozilla have released the first beta of Firefox 4. With this new version comes several noticeable changes. The most obvious change is one which is only present in Windows as of yet, but is a change which moves Firefox&#039;s UX closer to that of Google Chrome. The tabs no longer appear underneath the address bar, but above.
  Along with this change, in Windows 7 you also get a &amp;quot;Firefox button&amp;quot; which is a replacement of the menu bar - thus further reducing the real estate required by browser elements. The Awesomebar has also been renamed the &amp;quot;Smart Location Bar&amp;quot; and allows users to search for open tabs and to switch to them easily. The stop and reload buttons have also been merged into a single button - again similar to Google Chrome.
  The crash protection we saw added for plugins in version 3.6.6 has been expanded upon and improved in Firefox 4.
  Support has also been added for WebM (HD HTML 5 video format), WebGL (OpenGL-like standard for using 3D with the HTML 5 canvas tag), and further improvements to it&#039;s support for HTML 5.<p>Continue reading about "Firefox 4 Beta" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/878">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>

			<title>The Photographer's Ephemeris (TPE)</title>

				</div>I guess this should really be an &amp;quot;App of the week&amp;quot; post, but this one is aimed more at the photographers amongst you. Often when I&#039;m out and about visiting other countries I&#039;m keen on getting twilight and sunset shots, but don&#039;t always remember to look it up on the internet before I make my visit. This can cause problems with trying to guess the timing, and asking locals doesn&#039;t always help. 
  The Photographer&#039;s Ephemeris is an iPhone application which will provide the user with information for sunset, sunrise and more based upon the user&#039;s current locale. The application features: 
   
    Time and direction of sunrise and sunset 
    Time and direction of moonrise and moonset 
    Phase of the moon and % illumination 
    Times of civil, nautical and astronomical twilight 
    Graphical display on a map 
    Save any location you want - no fixed lists 
    Automatic time zone detection for any location on earth 
    Determines elevation above sea level 
    View azimuth and altitude of sun/moon for any time of day/night 
    Distance, bearing and elevation angle between any two points 
    Find when the sun/moon will appear from behind a hill 
    Compensation for atmospheric refraction 
    Compensation for elevation above the horizon 
    Does not require network connection for rise/set times and azimuths. (Note: maps and elevation do require a data connection) 
   
  That is some pretty essential information for providing you with the perfect lighting for your intended shot. The iPhone application costs &pound;5.49 but if you&#039;re in front of a PC or Mac you can download and use the AIR application for free. I think the desktop application is okay if you&#039;re somewhere with a network connection and can predict where you want to be attempting photographs from, but I think when you&#039;re out and about you can see some unexpected shots from different positions you haven&#039;t planned for (and hence making the iPhone application useful).<p>Continue reading about "The Photographer's Ephemeris (TPE)" on <a href="http://http://www.newearthonline.co.uk//article/877">New Earth Online</a>]]></description>
