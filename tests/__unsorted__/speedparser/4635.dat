While there, I fell absolutely in love with the region, and I took the opportunity to do some sightseeing. We traveled to Atlanta, Augusta, Aiken and Charleston, where I found myself in an incredibly bad mood for an hour or so. It descended completely out of the blue, brought on more than likely by wandering the packed stalls of the overpriced, touristy open-air flea market that runs along the main thoroughfare for several blocks. I don&#8217;t mind flea markets per se, but when I&#8217;m surrounded on all sides by sweaty bodies and loud noise with no chance of escape my optimism tends to go into hibernation mode.</p>
<p>I weaseled my way out of there and wandered off in the opposite direction. Down a side street I found a bar, the name for which I no longer even remember, that served nothing but alcohol out of what looked to be modified Slurpee dispensers. There were two dozen-plus varieties on offer, but the one that caught my eye was the drink called The Attitude Adjustment. Yeah, that&#8217;s about what I needed.</p>
<p>It tasted like whiskey and oranges, a lot like the homemade slush Mom used to make for card parties and holiday events, and as soon as I&#8217;d put away the whole 24oz plastic tumbler (a highly collectible keepsake, I&#8217;m sure) the drink began living up to its name. I spent the rest of the afternoon wandering the streets of Charleston, a town that appears to thrive on a curious mix of historic importance and commercial excess, with the semblance of a smile on my face before meandering a few blocks over to nearby Folly Beach and spending the remainder of my time playing in the ocean with my clothes on and dripping sea water all over the dining room of a local Mexican fusion restaurant. I&#8217;m sure they were thrilled to have me there.</p>
<p>I came back relaxed, refreshed and convinced a week in the South and exposure to tons of friendly people had yielded a somewhat kindler, gentler Jessica Brown. Then the Fall semester started back up, and I returned to my usual cyclical routine of going to class, wandering the campus sidewalks while evading shoulder-to-shoulder group bantering, attempting to ignore the toilet stall cellphone conversations and back-and-forth shouting present in every classroom that runs up to the minute before lecture begins. I spent most of my time not speaking and trying to drown out the constant chatter on campus, which never proves to be very successful.</p>
<p>Last week, I was supposed to receive a FedEx delivery at my house. I was on campus that morning, and apparently I needed to be there to sign for it. Seeing as how the package contained a new phone that I desperately needed, I raced an hour south of my home the moment my last class was over to pick it up at the sorting facility, where it had returned at the end of the day. Afterwards, I drove down into the city to hit up Half Price Books and buy myself a few early birthday presents. I wasn&#8217;t even sure what I was doing, as I was tired and half running on autopilot, but I found myself walking out of the bookstore with copies of <em>Journey to the End of the Night</em> and <em>Nausea</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Really</strong></em>, Jessica? And you sometimes wonder about <em><strong>putting people off</strong></em>?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if thirty-three is the magical year of self-discovery, but a certain medical condition has been brought to my attention recently, and if I had health insurance I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d be running to my general practitioner to solidify my diagnosis. I don&#8217;t think I really need him to confirm the obvious, though, as the evidence is all right here:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s incurable.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mom and Dad. Weren&#8217;t you supposed to have me inoculated for this before I could enroll in kindergarten?</p>

Perhaps there&#8217;s more than one trick going on, but the same things have cropped up once again. We&#8217;ve still got dirty old men, Houellebecq&#8217;s spite, Scrotie McBoogerballs, body modification and goofy memes to thank for most of the site traffic. Occasionally, here and there in much smaller concentrations, are a few legitimately academic phrases, but they&#8217;re drowning in a sea of dick and fart jokes.</p>
<p>Story of my life, really. I could perhaps be one of the most immature existentialist buttmunches on the planet, and that&#8217;s saying a lot. Maybe I should change my name to Jean-Paul Fartz or something.</p>
<p>Wait. Back this up for a moment. What the <strong><em>hell</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Two</em></strong> people needed to know what a tampon looked like, so they wandered over here? Hm.</p>
<p>You know you can buy them in a box at the store if you&#8217;re curious, right? Actually, that&#8217;s rather boring. To the person or persons, assuming they&#8217;re male, who really need to know what that absorbent wad of cotton and rayon looks like, here&#8217;s what you should do &#8212; dig a quarter out of your pocket, sneak into a public women&#8217;s restroom, and buy one. When you&#8217;re done analyzing it, stick it up your nose. I did that once when I was young, impressionable and thought Beavis and Butthead was the greatest thing ever. So, for all anyone knows, I may well have done this just yesterday. I wound up giving myself a nosebleed, the most meta joke I think I&#8217;ve ever made.</p>

This time around, one of my texts was Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jprof.com/history/franklin-apologia.html">Apology for Printers</a>. I sat down a few days ago and began skimming the relatively short piece, only to become transfixed by what I read on the page. Not only was Franklin phenomenally erudite, but he was clever, self-depricating and sarcastic to boot. What was titled as an apology (which, during his time, was considered to be more of an explanation or defense than a simple &#8220;hey, sorry about that&#8221;) was clearly, to me at least, an exceptionally polite method of flipping off his audience, and he pulled it off flawlessly.</p>
<p>Ahh, those intellectual trolls, forever after my own snarky little heart.</p>
<p>As it turns out, our reflective papers are required to be objective and academic, not the subjective and personal mix of memory and analysis that I, and a good number of my classmates, assumed was required of us. Seeing as how communication broke down somewhere, or student/professor expectations failed to intersect, we&#8217;ve all been given a do-over in order to meet course criteria. I was a bit too pleased with the results of my reflection to let this short, punchy essay (which treads familiar ground, for those noticing the bits of repetitiveness interspersed throughout) languish in some dusty, underutilized folder on my hard drive, so it will find a permanent resting place here on the site.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>An Apology for Printers</strong></em></p>
<p>Reading Ben Franklin’s response to his public detractors struck an immediate chord within me, mostly due to my activities outside the University. I’ve written prose and have been included in a handful of themed anthologies over the years, but what I’m most known for are my essays, literary criticisms and the occasional freelance editing job.</p>
<p>In a way, it brings me comfort to know that Franklin dealt (and dealt well, in my opinion) with public sentiments that appear no different than those I see today, but on the other hand it also dismays me to realize that, seeing as how this has gone on for centuries, a nearly solipsistic worldview may be some sort of ingrained response for a large number of people.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I found myself standing in a Barnes and Noble, staring at a book with the unusual title of <em>Necrophilia Variations</em>. I didn’t buy it at that point in time, but I visited its Amazon listing to see what responses the work had generated up until that point. There was only one review, a two-sentence, single-starred quip that came from someone who obviously hadn’t read it and more than likely had never even touched a copy with their own hands. “Necrophilia, really? If you enjoy this kind of thing, go kill yourself right now.” I found myself so irritated with this “my opinion über alles” tactic that I found myself responding just to tell them off. A year later, my critique (and interview of the author) found its way onto the Huffington Post, and I’m happy to say that both the author, Supervert, and I are alive and doing well.</p>
<p>Last year, I watched as a fellow critic was forced to stand his ground after giving a mostly favorable review to a book that, in my opinion, was a horrible piece of garbage. The author clearly did not revise her work at all before uploading her document file to Amazon (as an e-book), nor did she employ an editor or copyeditor. He praised the story, the character development, the wordplay… and then simply stated that it was poorly edited and could have used a good deal of polish before its release into the public wilds. The author emailed him, absolutely livid. “Besides if you want to throw crap at authors you should first ask their permission if they want it stuck up on the internet via e-mail. That debate is high among authors. Your [sic] the target not me! Now get this review off here!” Needless to say, the reviewer’s site became a flooded battleground of authors believing critics owed them something and the public who felt the author was out of line. I wrote an incredibly long essay detailing my opinion on it, as well.</p>
<p>It does seem to me that Franklin’s belief that no other profession receives the public scorn as the printer is still, three hundred-plus years later, scarily accurate. As technologies have advanced over time, the role of the printer has expanded to include, in many cases, the roles of writer and publisher, but the overwhelming demand to cave to the public (or, more specifically, each element that comprises the public <em>individually</em>, an impossible task to begin with) has remained constant. It never fails to shock and appall me when witnessing how a large number of people deal with personal offense – <strong><em>this disgusts me, therefore it’s an offense to humanity, and you are a horrible human being for saying what you just said. </em></strong></p>
<p>Where is the personal freedom? Where is the responsibility of the individual? Apparently, I (and anyone else who sets pen to paper or fingers to keys) must first consider the delicate (and manipulative; don’t for a moment think I don’t know what you’re doing, you antagonistic little brat) sensibilities of every singular member of the public before we say anything, lest we find ourselves on the receiving end of a verbal flogging. These demanding members of the public, those who find their opinions equivalent to moral law, have no responsibilities. They do what they want in an attempt to control their environments, while those working with the printed word must first go to them with their proofs and hope they haven’t offended anyone to the point where their work must be kept from publication. Only in an imbecilic, childish mind would this ever even come close to approaching reality.</p>
<p>Until reality breaks down and all of humanity finds itself existing in some parallel, Bizarroverse dimension, writers and publishers will be attacked by overbearing, entitled members of the public. We will continue our merry fourth estate business, forever dodging rotten tomatoes and barbed words, and we will give our detractors more courtesy than they deserve, which is more than they ever give us.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>On a related note, I can&#8217;t even hear/read the words &#8220;Ben Franklin&#8221; without immediately thinking of two things:</p>

In July (god, I can&#8217;t even type out those two words without thinking of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixt_t46k4Q">Orson Welles</a>; thanks, Mr. Greif), just as in June, some of them involve dirty old men and young girls.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t have titled my essay on Bukowski <a href="http://defiledcurator.com/2010/11/04/a-young-girl-and-an-old-man-a-love-story/">&#8220;A Young Girl and an Old Man &#8212; A Love Story&#8221;</a> if I hadn&#8217;t wanted the pedophiles to show up. Have I ever mentioned that my hindsight is surgical, while my futuresight&#8217;s a bit weak? Is &#8220;futuresight&#8221; even a real concept?</p>
<p>This month, though, apparently there&#8217;s been a lot of paranormal activity on the site. Some of it may have to do with the release of <em>Rain&#8217;s</em> first few chapters, though I doubt that explains much. Someone, or several someones, wandered in here looking for funny ghosts. There&#8217;s some ghosts on here, somewhere, but they&#8217;re mostly pathetic and/or creepy. Is Marcus funny? I suppose, in places. He&#8217;s funnier in his own head most of the time, though.</p>
<p>Also, is that my name in there? Yes, yes it is. Someone&#8217;s been looking for me, too. Also, I&#8217;m fairly certain &#8220;your tight ass and your perfect little tits&#8221; is for me as well.</p>
<p>I feel flattered.</p>
<p>One of them I just don&#8217;t understand. &#8220;Sexy tattoo for my possy&#8221;? Do they mean &#8220;posse&#8221;? Is there a flamboyant group of amazingly attractive outlaws riding through the dust-covered Wild West right this very moment?</p>
<p>The world may never know.</p>

<td>from the amorous point of view véronique belonged as we all do to a sacrificed generation. she had certainly been capable of love; she wished to still be capable it i ll say that for her; but it was no longer possible. a scarce artificial and belated phenomenon love can only blossom under certain mental conditions rarely conjoined and totally opposed to the freedom of morals which characterizes the modern era. véronique had known too many discothèques too many lovers; such a way of life impoverishes a human being inflicting sometimes serious and always irreversible damage. love as a kind of innocence and as a capacity for illusion as an aptitude for epitomizing the whole of the other sex in a single loved being rarely resists a year of sexual immorality and never two. in reality the successive sexual experiences accumulated during adolescence undermine and rapidly destroy all possibility of projection of an emotional and romantic sort; progressively and in fact extremely quickly one becomes as capable of love as an old slag.</td>

In fact, as of July 2011, it is as yet unfinished. The project&#8217;s name was <em>Rain</em>, and it was undertaken due to the dual influences of boredom and a newfound love for Takahashi Genichiro&#8217;s POMO-on-crack novel <a href="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Rain-Six-Frozen-Solid.pdf">Sayonara, Gangsters</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t read <em>Sayonara</em>, you&#8217;re doing yourself a disservice. Pick it up on the cheap, devour it, love it. Don&#8217;t bother resisting, as it&#8217;s a wasted expenditure of energy. This book will suck you in, make you scratch your head, and cause you to love it like the black sheep of your bookshelf before you even realize what&#8217;s come over you.</p>
<p>This little disjointed tale, if it can even be called that, is not making any &#8220;Oprah&#8217;s picks&#8221; lists any time soon. For one, there are no molested children in it. I probably should have thought about that while I was half-assing the plot in my head, but at that time I had no pretense of being destined for glory. I still don&#8217;t, but at least I can contingency plan a bit better these days.</p>
<p>Next time, I&#8217;ll be sure to add the tear-jerker stuff that will bring all the Lifetime Channel producers to the yard, or at least the literary agents.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not going to be on anyone&#8217;s tally of must-read fiction. That&#8217;s okay, as it was meant to be an endurance match between myself and, uh, myself. One of us lost, or is still losing, as THE END is still a few chapters off. Regardless, the feedback I received was positive and I had a blast writing the weird little thing, so I figured it should be included here on the site, if only as its final resting place.</p>

From my &#8220;nerd fish&#8221; avatar on Facebook, to my constant prattling on about my fish tanks (now, sadly, dismantled) to those who&#8217;ve witnessed me sleeping with a stuffed shark, it&#8217;s pretty obvious. I can&#8217;t get enough of the ocean, and the joke of it is that I live in a state with no direct access to any of them.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Defiled Curator Bizarroverse.</p>
<p>A year or two ago I won a copy of Severed Press&#8217;s anthology <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Bait-David-Dunwoody/dp/0980606500/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1310434679&amp;sr=8-1">Dead Bait</a></em>, signed, sealed and delivered by the sexy (and talented) David Dunwoody. I loved it (especially the cover art; skeletal piranha are creepily intimidating, even if their real-life counterparts are shy and pretty low-key), so when the opportunity came to submit to their follow-up antho I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>Well, you win some and you lose some. <em>Blackfish</em> didn&#8217;t make the cut, but I enjoy it enough to share it here. It may not be my best-ever piece of short fiction, but it was fun to write, which makes it a winner in my book.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>Anne looked up from her toast and eggs as I walked into the kitchen. “Another one this morning.” She jerked her thumb back over her shoulder before smoothing out her hair and pulling it back into a humidity-wrecked ponytail. Rogue strands formed black curls that framed her face, adhering themselves to her skin as our ancient A/C unit chugged and sputtered against the futility of its job. “You can see it from out the window. It’s further up the shore this time.”</p>
<p>I pushed the gauzy summer curtains aside and peered out. Through double glass I caught the smell of something rotting, a scent that was quickly becoming less oddity and more default for the neighborhood. “Was it a whale again?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Another orca.”</p>
<p>“That’s what, four now? Three yesterday, one this morning. I&#8217;ve never seen them pile up so fast.” Normally we were burdened with the unfortunate beaching once a year, if that, news vans and camera crews racing across our sandy yard to snap pictures that would show up on every newspaper website and before-bed program across the country. Not only were dying whales the perfect thing to tug on American heartstrings, but they brought attention to the sleepy beach towns these behemoths chose to off themselves on as well.</p>
<p>From a cynic’s viewpoint, the infrequent tragedy benefited the community. Still, the thought of a large animal, alone and fighting death just a stone’s throw from my porch, suffering in the early summer sun made me cringe a bit. I couldn’t help feeling pity for the creature despite knowing there wasn’t much I as one young woman could do for it.</p>
<p>Besides, I told myself, from the smell, any help I would be able to provide at this point would be wasted.</p>
<p>Multiple whales, however, changed the situation from one of small-town need to a rotting ecological failure, especially if corpses were dotting the seaboard and creating logistical nightmares for numerous picturesque beach towns.</p>
<p>“The radio says they&#8217;re doing it all across the country,” Anne said.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Several states up and down the Atlantic, and reports just started coming in from the West Coast as well. The township is closing the whole shoreline down for now, and the other municipalities will probably do the same thing, at least until the bodies are removed. What happens when beached whales die? Have you ever thought about that? We watch people pour water over them, try to hoist them up and drag them back out to sea, but when every effort fails, what do they do with the bodies? Burn them?”</p>
<p>“Probably. It’s the only logical way to deal with it. I have a better question for you, though. Who would swim next to a giant corpse?”</p>
<p>“If they felt the need to post legal ‘Beach Closed’ signs, then apparently there’s at least one tourist out there clueless enough to do it. You’ve seen <em>Jaws</em>. If sharks with mouths full of razored teeth don’t scare people enough to stay out, then why would a few dead Shamu?  I’m heading down to check things out in a few minutes. Want to go with me?”</p>
<p>“Do you really want to join the rescue crew?” We’d never volunteered for cleanup before today; Most of our time had been spent in University classrooms, though with summer break upon us we really had nothing to occupy our time most afternoons. Our bartending jobs didn’t require us to show up until after sundown.</p>
<p>“Do you have anything better to do? It&#8217;s in our back yard at this point. The neighbors will be down there before us. May as well get a peek at it, and if they need us for anything&#8230; It&#8217;s going to take a hell of a lot of work to clean everything up.”</p>
<p>“I guess, but—”</p>
<p>A knocking rattled our front door. <em>Shave-and-a-haircut</em>.</p>
<p>“Could you get that?” Anne’s eyes darted towards the door as she started cleaning up her dishes, piling them in the sink where they would, as usual, be left for a minimum of two days before any attention was returned to them. “I’m going to take a quick shower.”</p>
<p>“Were you expecting someone?”</p>
<p>She gave me a sly grin. “Not this early, but I bet I know who it is. Don’t you dare let him see me like this.”</p>
<p>“Fine, fine.”</p>
<p>I smoothed out my own hair before answering the door. It felt greasy, despite my having showered after my shift the night before. Only a few hours in bed in this heat and I’d woken looking like a junkie. For a moment I considered not even answering it, but I knew if I didn’t Anne would have my head.</p>
<p>A young deputy stood on our porch, his hands shoved into his pockets. I recognized him as one of our clientele from the night before, a friendly but subdued type who’d sat at the corner of the bar nursing one draught beer after another until closing time. Anne had served him, mostly, stopping by every few minutes to replenish his snack bowl or ask him if he wanted another drink. After a while, they’d started conversing, and by the end of the night she seemed somewhat interested in talking to him outside of work, an unusual turn of events considering how much she hated the drunk party guys who littered our bar most nights. He didn’t really fit that mold, though, nor of the loud and obnoxious drunk cop type. The two seemed perpetually at odds with one another, the migrant frat boy jackasses and the equally irritating year-rounders who had to babysit them whenever the weather grew warm. Neither group were particularly pleasant to deal with while intoxicated, and neither one generally tipped very well. This one, despite his age and occupation, fell squarely outside both groups. If Anne hadn’t snagged his attention, I more than likely would have found him equally interesting, myself.</p>
<p>I wished, for a moment, that I had been the first one into the shower. I could smell a warm fragrance drifting off my skin, not wholly unpleasant but indicative of the heat and humidity that had been assaulting me while I slept. I hoped it didn’t extend beyond my own capacity for smelling it.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” I said, leaning against the frame of the door. “I’m sorry, but I don’t remember your name. It was a little hectic at work last night.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay,” he said, extending his hand. “John Bernhard. Call me Jack.”</p>
<p>I shook his hand, hoping my own didn’t feel sticky. “Nice to meet you, Jack,” I said. “I’m Alex Moore, Anne’s roommate. Anne’s, uh, kind of busy.”</p>
<p>“It’s early,” he said. “I didn’t mean to stop by so soon, but I’m kind of in the neighborhood for work.” He jerked his thumb back over the sand dunes towards what I imagined to be the beached whale. My vision of it was obscured, but the smell, growing stronger now that I’d come outside, was unmistakable.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” I asked him. “Is it just the one?”</p>
<p>“God, no. There are at least five in our jurisdiction. Two orcas, a manatee, a dolphin and a seal. When was the last time anyone saw a seal around here? It’s been years, I think. Not since I was in middle school.”</p>
<p>“Are they…”</p>
<p>“Dead?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “It looks like they all came on shore overnight, probably while everyone was out drinking. Nobody noticed them until a few of the retirees went out for their morning walks.” He frowned. “I don’t think anyone was expecting a repeat of yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Why is it even happening?” I asked him. “This is beyond unnatural.”</p>
<p>“Officially?” he asked. When I nodded, he continued. “Nobody knows. However,” he said, “my brother’s a marine researcher over at the University. Anne said you’re both students, so you may have met him. Doctor Doug Bernhard?” When I shook my head, he went on. “Yeah, not surprising. He rarely makes appearances outside of his office or his research sites. Anyway, I spoke to him this morning, and he seems to think it has something to do with gas or whatnot escaping the sea floor. Something leaking out into the water, killing the marine life, that kind of thing. He doesn’t have much proof right now, not enough to close the beaches, but the bodies washing up are doing it for him.”</p>
<p>“Is it true that this is happening in other places?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He nodded and ran a hand through his sandy hair. “If it really is a leak of some kind, then it’s going on elsewhere, too. I really hope he’s wrong, but until we find a cause for it, there’s no way to tell.” He paused. “We’re going to have one hell of a time getting rid of all this.”</p>
<p>“Burning?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“Do you burn the bodies?”</p>
<p>Just then, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around just in time to see Anne, freshly showered and dressed in much nicer clothes that I was used to seeing her in outside of work, gliding through the kitchen towards the open door.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” she said, coming to a stop just behind my shoulder. I took it as a signal for me to make my exit, which I was actually grateful for. My fear of smelling gross, despite the overwhelming stench of rot in the air, was threatening to become full-blown paranoia.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” Jack said. “Your roommate and I were discussing the orcas.”</p>
<p>“Just like everyone else in this town, I bet.”</p>
<p>“Probably. And,” he said, turning his attention back to me, “we don’t burn them. Usually what happens is someone will rent or donate the use of an excavator, and it’s buried. It’s going to take a while to bury them all, which is why I’m here. The police are trying to keep everything coordinated. I have to go make sure nobody messes with the corpses until the crews are in place or, god forbid, goes into the water. Not that anyone will or anything.”</p>
<p>“I see,” I said.</p>
<p>Anne frowned. “That’s much less dramatic than what we thought happened. Oh, well.”</p>
<p>I nodded towards him. “Nice talking with you, Jack.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “Good to meet you, Alex.”</p>
<p>“It looks like someone decided to film one of those low-budget schlock horror movies in the middle of a Sea World,” I said, swinging my binoculars in one hand and sniffing at my shoulder. The smell of sweat and fatigue was gone, salt and organic rot quickly replacing it. “Everything’s dropping.” I watched a crab topple helplessly like an origami facsimile as I nudged it with my toe. It, like everything around us, was dead, another empty husk left to decompose in the spot where it had ceased to function.</p>
<p>“It’s surreal,” Anne said, tossing a pebble and watching it roll to a stop against a glistening blob that had once been a jellyfish. “Like a diorama or something, only made out of real things.”</p>
<p>The rest of the neighborhood, like Anne had predicted, had already beaten us to the first dead orca. They made a ring around the giant corpse, staring and snapping photos as it expanded in the sun. From where I stood, I could barely tolerate the stench, and I couldn&#8217;t understand why anyone would subject themselves to the full brunt of the odor just for a few lousy photographs of a dead cetacean.</p>
<p>Police and volunteers dotted the shoreline, and way off in the distance I could see similar mounds and milling crowds at various intervals.</p>
<p>A radio crackled behind me, and I turned my head to see an older officer only a few feet away. He held his radio close to his ear but I could still hear the transmission. <em>“You need to get down here. Something&#8217;s going on with the whale.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em>“&#8217;Going on&#8217;?”</p>
<p><em>“It&#8217;s moving.”</em></p>
<p>“It’s gas. That always happens.”</p>
<p><em>“No, it’s actually moving. I just saw a fin twitch, and—&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em> </em>“Give me a goddamn break, Charlie. It&#8217;s early, I can&#8217;t smell anything but rot and shit, and I&#8217;m not in the mood.”</p>
<p><em>“No, Jim. It&#8217;s moving, and it just&#8211;”</em> The crackling ceased, and the radio went silent. <em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em>“You still there?”</p>
<p><em> </em>Noise drowned him out, the sound of screams, both in the distance and broadcast through radio waves, overpowering the voice of just one man. It sounded like a whisper nestled inside a howl, funneled through a tiny speaker<em>. “Holy shit, Jim, it just bit someone. It&#8217;s Jack. It took his fucking arm off!” </em>Despite the tinny quality, I could hear the astonishment in his voice.</p>
<p>“All right, joker.” He snapped his radio off and slowly walked down the beach. A column of ambulances could be seen speeding in our direction through town, and the faint screaming grew louder, people pouring up over the dunes, running back to their homes.</p>
<p>I lifted my binoculars to my eyes. Several human-shaped dots lay in the sand around the much larger corpse of the orca, unmoving.</p>
<p>I looked at Anne. “Am I really seeing this?”</p>
<p>Her mouth hung open. “Jack? Did he just say ‘Jack’?&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned my head, watching the corpse just ahead of us, feeling my feet back-up on autopilot. The boardwalk was only a hundred yards away, and our house lay just beyond it.</p>
<p>In front of me, a bloated fluke twitched, and the orca&#8217;s jovial grin split wide open.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2738" href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/07/04/june/wtf/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2738" title="wtf" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wtf-216x300.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="300" /></a>From time to time, I find myself in DefiledCurator.com&#8217;s control panel, analyzing data to amuse myself. It seems more people visit this site for the stupid meme pictures I blatantly thieve off of Google Images than the textual content, which is fine, as they&#8217;re there for a reason (which is, primarily, to make myself laugh &#8212; feel free to chuckle along). Over the months, one of the features in the CP that has entertained me to no end is the &#8220;Search Keyphrases&#8221; section, which always seems to fill up with pottymouth humor. Sometimes it&#8217;s related to the site (I will totally cop to making all those queef jokes that appear to be drawing in the vaginophiles), sometimes not (just because I wrote one essay about enjoying Bukowski from a young age does not mean I am a huge fan of geriatrics trying to seduce teenaged girls), but no matter the phrase it&#8217;s damn hilarious.</p>
<p>This might become repetitive over the months, as the humor tends to follow a common theme (just like the webmaster, hurr), but until this renders itself boring enough to discontinue I will be publishing the search phrase list at the end of every month.</p>
<p>Data in the two rightmost columns are the amount of times each specific phrase string was utilized, followed by that phrase&#8217;s percentage in the total number of searches. There were a hundred and ten for June.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2703" href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/05/09/useless-degree/unknown/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2703" title="Unknown" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="225" /></a>When I was much younger, the first time I set foot on a University campus, my ever-practical mother lectured me on the applicability of my future degree. &#8220;What do you think you are going to do with a bachelor&#8217;s in English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, um, well… I, uh… Hm.&#8221; I was stumped. What <strong><em>was</em></strong> I going to do with it?</p>
<p>The question was irrelevant. I didn&#8217;t need that piece of paper anyway, right? I was going to be a <strong><em>WRITER</em></strong>.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done laughing, I&#8217;ll still be here. Take your time.</p>
<p>The second time, I found myself older, a bit more pragmatic and yet still determined to be the writer I always knew I was. This attempt, however, was backed with a logic I cultivated as my first line of defense against the real world in the interim years I spent separated from my ivory tower (which is constructed entirely with Lego; don&#8217;t let my convoluted syntax fool you for a moment), which led me into a Professional Writing focus rather than straight Literature. I could have my Humanities cake and eat it too, god damn it.</p>
<p>So, now that I&#8217;m nearing the completion of my degree, what can I do with it?</p>
<p>When I first saw the film <em>A Knight&#8217;s Tale</em> in the theatre ten years ago, I was entertained but largely unimpressed. It wasn&#8217;t a bad film; I just didn&#8217;t connect with it. A few months ago, sitting in my History of the Development of English class, I watched as an acquaintance of mine gave a brief lecture on Geoffrey Chaucer. <em>Wasn&#8217;t Chaucer in that Heath Ledger movie?</em> I thought to myself. <em>The one where Ledger jousts and Rufus Sewell is a complete tool? He was pretty funny.</em></p>
<p>I went home and found a cheap copy of the DVD on Amazon, curious to see whether the film held up after a ten-year absence and a newfound sense of English history.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t hold up at all. Instead, what I found upon my second viewing was a completely different film than the one I&#8217;d sat through in the dark, munching on greasy popcorn and glaring at theatre-chatters. Was this even the same script?</p>
<p><em>My god,</em> I found myself thinking. <em>This is a marxist, feminist, slightly postmodern take on the relations between Normans and Anglo-Saxons during the Middle English period with clever anachronisms, witty dialogue and a badass soundtrack. This is the most amazing film I&#8217;ve seen in ages.</em></p>
<p>Along with Errol Morris&#8217; McNamara film <em>The Fog of War, A Knight&#8217;s Tale </em>has been serving as comfortable background noise during schoolwork sessions for two or three months now. The story is so familiar to me at this point that it bypasses my active brain and runs straight into the subconscious. I can be typing away furiously at my keyboard, churning out page after page of literary analysis, and when a scene I particularly enjoy comes on I can immerse myself in it without even having to look up. For a linguistics and theory geek, it&#8217;s the most perfectly-crafted academic accoutrement possible.</p>
<p>Chaucer is absolutely amazing. I cannot find a clip of his introduction, where he walks naked and covered in dirt after having lost his clothes gambling, but it is the funniest thing I think I may have ever seen. Chaucer (who was educated in French but broke tradition to write in English with a healthy dose of the vernacular, an oddity due to the Latinate/French-speaking literate populace and the illiteracy of most non-nobles) stops and converses with Sir Ulrich/William Thatcher (Ledger) and his squires Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Turdyk), explaining to the trio that he is a &#8220;writer&#8221; (which they have little understanding of) and assumes they&#8217;ve heard of him. They, a group of Anglo-Saxon peasants pretending to be nobles, have no clue who the hell he even is.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://aknightstale.ficology.com/viewstory.php?skin=default2&amp;sid=52&amp;chapter=7">transcript</a> of the chapter (Ch. 4, &#8220;Chaucer the Trudger&#8221;). Much of the humor is lost on paper, but that&#8217;s the gist of it.</p>
<p>I have never witnessed a scene in popular film this witty and full of wordplay. Every time Wat mockingly calls over his shoulder, &#8220;This <em><strong>is</strong></em> the road to Rouen!&#8221; I nearly choke. Same with Chaucer and Roland&#8217;s misguided response to the word &#8220;allegorical.&#8221;</p>
<p>My god, I have never seen anything quite so amazing.</p>
<p>So… what can I do with this little degree of mine?</p>
<p>I can make &#8220;okay&#8221; movies <strong><em>awesome</em></strong>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2689" href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/05/08/dissecting-the-simulacrum/no-tv/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2689" title="no tv" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/no-tv-300x251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="251" /></a>I&#8217;d originally planned on conducting a multilayered analysis of Albert Camus&#8217; <em>The Stranger</em> for my final Critical Theory paper this semester, but upon review and discussion with my professor we both decided that the scope of my initial concept was a bit too broad for an undergraduate project. It was quickly set aside as a frontrunner for a master&#8217;s thesis further on down the timeline.</p>
<p>I needed something much shorter, though possessing enough depth that it could withstand the application of multiple analytical lenses and enough content that it could be scrutinized for ten or more pages. Within a few days, I decided to take a look at the short stories of J.G. Ballard, though which one was a difficult choice. It came down to one of three: <em>The Index, Answers to a Questionnaire </em>or <em>A Guide to Virtual Death.</em></p>
<p>I finally decided on a five-hundred-word story structured as a television programming schedule. It was a wise choice, I believe. <em>A Guide to Virtual Death </em>is fascinating and deceptively simplistic, and was one of the most engaging and rewarding reading experiences I&#8217;ve encountered in a long time.</p>
<p>Seeing as how my paper will not be returned to me for some time, I&#8217;m uploading the PDF sans professorial marginalia. Once that changes, the file will as well. I&#8217;m on pins and needles waiting to find out what my instructor thinks of it.</p>
<p>Note: Many thanks, as well, to Xander Walker for sharing his video adaptation.</p>

I really shouldn&#8217;t call it &#8220;horrible&#8221;; they do it to me just as much as I do it to them, and it&#8217;s become a sick and immature tradition at this point. Last year, for his nineteenth birthday, I bought my hardline atheist friend and coworker Eli [<em>an atheist with an extremely Biblical name, how <strong>cute</strong></em>] a 100-pack of <a href="http://www.chick.com/default.asp">Chick Tracts</a> and brought them into the shop with me. He laughed, and we spent a good hour or so after our shifts were over going through them and giggling like demented children.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Chick thinks I&#8217;m serious and keeps sending me catalogs and free samples. Normally, I just hoard them until I see Eli again and foist them on him. I get to remove them from my possession and he acquires new material with which to concoct his &#8220;LOL Jebus&#8221; jokes; it&#8217;s a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Today found me curious enough to open the one I&#8217;d just received and, well, it was a doozy. It was hilarious for all the wrong reasons. I suppose, when you utilize something for the purpose of explicit mockery, no reason is really all that wrong.</p>
<p>Included in the half-sized envelope was a multilingual catalog with ordering sheet, a self-addressed return envelope, a missive titled &#8220;Let&#8217;s Face It &#8212; We&#8217;re Outnumbered&#8221; about evangelicals being overwhelmed with the amount of people they need to witness to, a small magazine called <em>Battle Cry </em>(featuring a story on missionaries; have I ever mentioned just how much <em><strong>I love missionaries</strong></em>? /sarcasm), two sample comics and the most amazing cover letter I have ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>They sent <em><strong>this</strong></em> to a marxist, feminist, post-structuralist critical theory student:</p>

<p>Oh my god, I can&#8217;t breathe. Please make it stop.</p>
<p>Tattoos, piercings, swearing and substance use are all unladylike?</p>
<p>Oh, <strong><em>shit</em></strong>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/03/31/it-needs-to-be-said/mr-lolcat/" rel="attachment wp-att-2624"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2624" title="mr.lolcat" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mr.lolcat-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="285" /></a>Seeing as how my Facebook feed is comprised mainly of fellow authors, many of them small-press or self-published (and who are, by and large, absolutely phenomenal; I could devote an entire post to just listing the excellent works of friends and associates I&#8217;ve been exposed to over the last few years, but that would be nepotic as all get out), I need to word this very carefully so that the wrong people don&#8217;t find themselves offended over what I&#8217;m about to say and that the people I am talking about don&#8217;t recognize themselves in their entirety here. I&#8217;m delivering a message, one I feel is extremely important for everyone with literary tendencies, not attempting to spark yet another boring and pointless author fight. I&#8217;ve seen them, I&#8217;ve been in the margins for a few, and they don&#8217;t interest me.</p>
<p>Some authors need to both act like adults and administer, to themselves, a massive reality check.</p>
<p>As I am Little Miss Perpetually Late to the Party, I&#8217;m fairly certain this issue has been addressed at least a hundred times by now, but seeing as how most of the flak has come from fellow authors, I&#8217;d like to toss my perspective out as well.</p>
<p>Most people are already familiar, I&#8217;m sure, with Jacqueline Howett, her book<em> The Greek Seaman</em> (oh hai, amusing multiple signifieds! [Knock it off with the Theory jokes already, nerd girl. -- DC]), the review that triggered a massive temper tantrum and the aftermath that reverberated around the internet.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar, <a href="http://booksandpals.blogspot.com/2011/03/greek-seaman-jacqueline-howett.html">this</a> is where it began. Read it and come back. I&#8217;ll still be here, mostly because I have no life.</p>
<p>As I said before, several others have already covered her unprofessional behavior. I&#8217;m annoyed about something completely different. If one author nobody knows anything about shoots herself in the foot before the public has a chance to read and enjoy her work, does anyone hear it?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This is what has me highly annoyed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Besides if you want to throw crap at authors you should first ask their permission if they want it stuck up on the internet via e-mail. That debate is high among authors.</p>
<p>Your the target not me!<br />
Now get this review off here!</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know where this debate is going on, actually. I wonder if there are any real writers involved.</p>
<p>Yes, I am a writer. However, I am (and will always be) predominantly an editor and critic. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been academically trained for, and what I&#8217;m pursuing advanced degrees in. I take my freelance editing jobs very seriously, and my critique work is done painstakingly at the cost of everything else I could be doing with my free time.</p>
<p>Apparently Jacqueline Howett believes that I do not have the right to stand in judgement of a text should my judgement be negative, or that I do not have the right to call out typographical mistakes. I do not have the right to point out where a text is weak just as thoroughly as I do where it is strong. Critics owe the authors, if not for bestowing them with free books to read but for writing in the first place.</p>
<p>That is absolute <em><strong>bullshit</strong></em>.</p>
<p>It has been said before that everyone&#8217;s a critic, and largely this is true. It may seem as if I&#8217;m copping an elitist attitude when I say this, but an untrained critic is actually a reviewer, which doesn&#8217;t negate their opinion. It just means that they automatically default to a pared-down version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism">reader-response theory</a> as their lens, which is entirely acceptable. Are the people I found both annoyingly inaccurate and immensely amusing in their interpretations of <a href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/02/21/when-a-goober-freaks-out/">Kafka</a> reviewers?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, yes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always a bit painful to read reviews wherein the reader doesn&#8217;t get it, but the best thing about dealing with reviewers is that the approach they almost always take is both incredibly easy to accept and incredibly easy to reject. They don&#8217;t generally go that deep into the text, they rely heavily on their own experiences and preferences, the author and the author&#8217;s intent are irrelevant and the only thing that matters is the reviewer themselves.</p>
<p>Like what they have to say, or appreciate the way in which they point out flaws or areas needing improvement in the text? Fine. Accept it.</p>
<p>Think they&#8217;re full of shit, don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about, or have missed the point of the work entirely? Stop paying attention. Bam. Done.</p>
<p>What you don&#8217;t do, whether dealing with a critic, a reviewer who knows what they&#8217;re talking about or a reviewer who doesn&#8217;t, is sacrifice your dignity, betray your ethics and (more than likely, in Howett&#8217;s case) tank your career over a negative review, especially an honest one.</p>
<p>Dramatic temper tantrums over negative responses to artistic work are not new. This is an age-old, incredibly annoying and mind-blowingly counterproductive practice that some authors, playwrights, visual artists and musicians employ with almost clockwork regularity. Vincent Gallo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brown_Bunny">did not react well at all</a> to Roger Ebert&#8217;s critique of his film <em>The Brown Bunny</em>. It&#8217;s the reason John Simon <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1282/the-art-of-criticism-no-4-john-simon">wound up with steak tartare</a> thrown in his face, and why I anticipate my own food-related assault at some point in the future. It&#8217;s the reason why Alice Hoffman <a href="http://defiledcurator.com/2009/07/10/dealing-with-criticism/">vented her anger on Twitter</a> instead of walking away from her computer and doing something productive instead of fuming.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unprofessional, egotistic and reduces the author to an elementary school child screaming and rolling on the floor, attempting to extort the adults into caving, and in a professional setting absolutely does not work.</p>
<p>A critic owes an author nothing. A critic&#8217;s responsibility is to the public, the work being critiqued, and to the truth. The author, once the text/album/film/play/etc is let loose into the world, relinquishes control over the work, who sees it and the responses it garners. To insist that a critic should feel the need to <strong><em>ask permission from the author </em></strong>to speak freely is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Not going to happen, Howett. If you can&#8217;t deal with it, pack it up and go home, and leave your manuscripts on your hard drive where nobody else has access to them and cannot hurt your feelings by pointing out your weak spots.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve said enough about the roles of the critic and author. Now I&#8217;d like to lay out my opinion on the role (or lack thereof) of the editor, which is equally important and equally misunderstood.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m uncertain as to where and when this practice began, but being a writer does not automatically imbue one with the skill set necessary for editorship. This is something that annoys me to absolutely no end, this <em>Oh, well, I wrote a story and it was okay so naturally I can edit my friends&#8217; stories and slap the label of editor onto my resume.</em></p>
<p>An author is not by default an editor. Editors by and large are writers, but the reverse is absolutely not true.</p>
<p>I have lost track at this point of the number of poorly-edited books I&#8217;ve read, declined to read due to noticing the lack of quality prior to purchasing or have been asked to review. This both angers and depresses me a great deal, for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t approach a text hoping to hate it. Even when the author is someone I do not find personally appealing, or their work seems obnoxious, or I really want to hate it, I end up reminding myself that <a href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/02/04/expanding-the-self-via-opposition/">this is unprofessional behavior</a>. I begin reading with as purely objective an approach as possible, and I do not <strong><em>want</em></strong> to be let down. That would be a waste of my time, which is almost nonexistent these days. When I find a typographical error, the first time it is a momentary distraction from the text; if it&#8217;s the only one I find, no big deal. When I find a second one, it&#8217;s somewhat irritating, and I begin to entertain suspicions as to the quality of the text as a whole. Third, fourth, fifth typos and beyond are extremely annoying, and I find myself either abandoning the work or forcing my way through just to get it over with.</p>
<p>Authors, you do <em><strong>not </strong></em>want to inflict this kind of irritation on critics, reviewers or anyone else.</p>
<p>Just as a critic has an obligation to the truth and to the work, so too does the author. It never fails to confuse and annoy me when authors, most of whom are still struggling to establish themselves, spend a great deal of time working on a manuscript and then rush through revisions because they&#8217;re so desperate for people to read them. The revisions process is, by and large, harder than writing the first draft &#8212; not only do typos need to be weeded out, but the whole work has to be tracked as if it were one large organism made up of smaller, complex organ systems. There&#8217;s spelling to consider, syntax to scrutinize, continuity to track and a host of other details that can easily derail a text when placed into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>Make no mistake here, either &#8212; taking the attitude of <em>Well, she has a BA in Political Science and probably writes a lot for her job, so I think she&#8217;d make a great editor</em> is indeed placing a work into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons this happens so often is that small-press and self-publishing authors tend to run in circles. We like our fellow writers, collaborate with them, appear in the same anthologies and literary magazines and, for the most part, see ourselves as equals with one another. There&#8217;s a great deal of camaraderie, and often these social circles feel more like families than anything else.</p>
<p>Just because you like another author, or feel comfortable with them, or enjoy their work doesn&#8217;t automatically make them worthy of being an editor, and doing so is actually damaging the credibility of everyone in this field.</p>
<p>Editors have what I like to generically refer to as the &#8220;editorial eye.&#8221; Not a very impressive or creative description, I know. Editors must be able to spot errors of all kinds while reading through a manuscript, at the same time keeping track of continuity, characters and setting. This involves note-taking and memorization of a great deal of small details. An editor needs to be able to recognize not only the difference between &#8220;its&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; (which I have spotted the misuse of in a large number of books, from small and large presses, and <strong><em>media outlet websites </em></strong>as of late) but instances where a character&#8217;s words don&#8217;t match their personality, contradictions in the text and a host of other issues.</p>
<p>A writer writes; an editor edits. If a writer hasn&#8217;t studied or doesn&#8217;t understand grammar or linguistics, they&#8217;re not an editor. <strong><em>Period</em></strong>.</p>
<p>An editor is in a support position to the author, goes largely unnoticed and, except for some publishers&#8217; copyright pages and authors&#8217; acknowledgements sections, isn&#8217;t mentioned by name. It&#8217;s an analytical position, not to be taken lightly or for some sort of glamour agenda. There&#8217;s a reason everyone remembers Franz Kafka but not Max Brod. Editors are, for the most part, hidden; they exist to remove flaws and apply polish to a work, not to draw attention to themselves.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with wanting to be an author and not possessing the required editorial skills to go it a hundred percent alone. I do both and still rely on a few trusted associates to read over my work just to allow a set of fresh eyes the opportunity to pick up what I may have missed. Editors are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>That said, make sure your editor really is an editor before you choose someone to go over your manuscript, don&#8217;t confuse friendly feelings with professional ability, and for the love of all that is good in the world don&#8217;t go on the offensive when your mistakes are pointed out to you. If you fail to address them before the work goes public, it&#8217;s your fault, and nobody owes you anything.</p>
<p>In short, don&#8217;t do a damn thing Jacqueline Howett did.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2604" href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/03/28/the-end-of-an-era/findingemo/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2604" title="findingemo" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/findingemo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>This is not something I ever thought I would talk about in as public a forum as a website, though I know many people in the coming days are going to ask me to tell them what happened or send me emails or private messages on various social networking sites to see if I&#8217;m okay.</p>
<p>My significant other of ten years decided to break things off last night. Yes, I am fine; it was a largely amicable split, decided upon while the relationship was still brimming over with affection and understanding, and honestly changes very little. We&#8217;re not compatible, not like we were years ago, and we&#8217;re heading in two different directions. As it turns out, the both of us had been feeling this way for some time and, despite our best efforts to continue together in the same direction, it&#8217;s just not possible.</p>
<p>When we met, I was twenty-one and attending programming school in Pittsburgh. It was a terrible program and I never went beyond if/then statements before &#8220;graduating,&#8221; mostly due to the almost entire absence of our instructors. Instead of relying on them for help trying to figure out hexidecimals, I turned to one of my classmates, and we began dating shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Our breakup is due in a very large part to some deeply ingrained neuroses that I may well end up dealing with my entire life. I&#8217;ve talked about my (largely dealt with and laid to rest) depression <a href="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Delete.pdf">on this site</a> before, but I have never fully discussed what went on beyond most people&#8217;s notice and I do not think I ever will. Suffice it to say that I was severely despondent for several years, to the point of self-destruction, and his love, patience and unending support in a very large part saved my life. During our discussion last night, he asserted that it was never him who helped me but myself without my own acknowledgement, but he and I will have to disagree on this point for the rest of our lives. You can&#8217;t have a dialectic without dissent, and dissent makes life interesting. Eric, I am alive today because of you.</p>
<p>This past Friday, I met with one of my professors to discuss graduate programs, conference presentations, recommendation letters and admission into the department Honors Society. I now have the confidence and backing of nearly every professor I have studied under since my return to a collegiate environment. I work as a freelance editor and book reviewer and have written several highly-regarded works of academic merit, not to mention a number of short fiction pieces and a few novels waiting patiently for final edits. The old me of several years ago would not have been able to accomplish one of these tasks, and he has been there every day for ten years urging me to become a better person. I am a success not only because of my own drive but because of the motivation that came in the form of his support. I will be forever grateful, and I cherish every one of those days we had together, even the darker ones that I barely remember during which I had to play bargaining games with myself just to get out of bed.</p>
<p>As my confidence and capability increased, so did my own level of self-involvement. After returning to college, and especially after transferring to the University this past autumn, we barely saw each other. Yesterday was the third day we&#8217;d found enough time to see each other since the beginning of 2011. A relationship can&#8217;t sustain itself on absence, and he was right in asserting that he needed someone who not only shared more of his interests but had the time and inclination to participate in them alongside him.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that someone more suitable is about to cross his path. He&#8217;s incredibly amicable (something that annoyed me to no end when I was in my depressive phase &#8212; being a complete and total Eeyore around someone predisposed to optimism is very draining), generous, thoughtful (he gives the most amazing birthday, holiday and anniversary gifts &#8212; we used to attempt to outdo each other, and the gift battles were impressive) and loves physical contact. A stoic no-hand-holding robot like myself really doesn&#8217;t give him enough chances to shine.</p>
<p>So for the lucky one unaware of the good fortune on her horizon, I have a few suggestions. Love him, appreciate him, play those silly video games with him when he asks you to, and never stop telling him just how gorgeous his prematurely grey hair is. I don&#8217;t think he ever fully believed me when I teased him about it, but I meant every word.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2588" href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/03/25/chomsky/noam-noam-noam/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2588" title="noam-noam-noam" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/noam-noam-noam-300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s probably the most boring title for an academic work I&#8217;ve ever written. I&#8217;m kind of ashamed, really &#8212; I almost twisted some <em>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </em>lyrics for humor (they&#8217;re both Philadelphia natives), but I didn&#8217;t want to push it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken linguistics courses for two semesters now, and despite the tendency for our material to be overly dry I&#8217;ve still found a lot to enjoy. This semester&#8217;s course, History of the Development of the English Language, takes a chronological look at the inception and advancement of English through colonization, expansion of empires and military campaigns, beginning with the Romans and ending with the Norman Invasion and the influence of Latinate languages on a predominantly Anglo-Saxon populace. From there, it becomes a study on class influence and the importance of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester we were arbitrarily assigned topics for research papers. The topics were listed in chronological order and the class roster reverse-alphabetically. Some topics were more obscure than others; one of my classmates, whose last name ends with V, wound up with the Venerable Bede. Other topics include the Black Death, Alfred the Great and Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>
<p>I got Noam Chomsky. You know you&#8217;re a freaking dork when you&#8217;re randomly assigned a topic and you&#8217;re so pleased with your luck of the draw that you begin bouncing in your seat.</p>
<p>We were instructed to write on our topic both as if we were discussing it casually and our audience wasn&#8217;t intimately familiar with it, and were told by Dr. Zeiger to &#8220;avoid writing like a stuffy academic &#8212; write the way you would normally write, and include your own opinions on the topic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Um. Uh… Oh, shit.</p>
<p>How does one avoid writing like a stuffy academic when that is one&#8217;s typical mode of communication? I can&#8217;t even think about injecting subjective thought into a paper unless it&#8217;s subtly wound in with the facts. There is no way that I can avoid looking stuffy, and at this point, I&#8217;m hoping my professor realizes this. All of our exams are essay, written by hand into a Blue Book. He&#8217;s a fair grader, and he knows my work and syntax by now. Here&#8217;s hoping he appreciates it.</p>
<p>As the semester wears on, we&#8217;ve been giving, in chronological order, five-minute lectures on our topics in preparation for their inclusion on the final. Seeing as how mine&#8217;s mid-twentieth century and we&#8217;ve just gone over Chaucer (I was waiting for my classmate to mention naked Chaucer in <em>A Knight&#8217;s Tale</em>, which I bought on DVD just for that character &#8212; Paul Bettany is hilarious), I should be giving my presentation in several weeks.</p>
<p>We probably will not be receiving grades for these papers until the very end of the semester, so I&#8217;m jumping the gun and posting my work ahead of time. I&#8217;m that pleased with it. In fact, I think I may have written the longest paper in the class (instructions were &#8220;3000 words or roughly ten pages&#8221; &#8212; I did 3200 words just to make sure I met the page count and when formatting was over ended up with a thirteen-page work) and I&#8217;m almost certain I&#8217;m the only one to have cited pornography in the text and used a compendium of arthouse smut as a source.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2561" href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/03/24/you-help-your-landlady%e2%80%a6-carry-out-her-garbage/matrix_simulacra/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2561" title="matrix_simulacra" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/matrix_simulacra-300x165.png" alt="" width="300" height="165" /></a>To continue my Baudrillard discussion from yesterday (<em>What discussion? That was, like, a <strong>comment</strong> or something</em>), I need to give a brief rundown of my Theory course and what it entails.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a once a week night class, held on Tuesday evenings. We&#8217;re given (usually) several authors to read up on in both Peter Barry&#8217;s <em>Beginning Theory</em> and a spiral bound packet full of excerpts of longer work hand designed by our professor. Usually we read three or four pieces, often including one work of short fiction, and are expected to summarize our readings and analyze the week&#8217;s fiction piece. So far we&#8217;ve covered Marxist theory (two weeks), psychoanalytic theory (three weeks), structuralism and post-structuralism (two weeks) and are now rounding out our postmodernism work before moving on to new historicism, disability studies, post-colonialism and feminism.</p>
<p>Most of my reading responses are less summarization and more application of what I&#8217;ve read onto other ideas. For instance, instead of rewording our textbook definition of postmodernism, this is (partially) what my response looked like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Throughout the chapter on postmodernism, I kept trying to come up with real-world examples to illustrate the differences. The best example of postmodernism I could come up with (that hadn&#8217;t already been done before, to the best of my knowledge) is a seven-story recreation of the Mona Lisa hung on a public building. Instead of the face of the mysterious, slightly smiling woman, the author bio photo from the dust jacket of Stephenie Meyer&#8217;s novel <em>Twilight</em> could be swapped in. How&#8217;s that for a blending of high and low art?</p></blockquote>
<p>My responses are page after page of this kind of goofball rambling. Also during the same week:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for the difference between modernism and post modernism, I kept picturing a very serious man, dressed in a suit, standing in the middle of a room reciting the entirety of <em>Ulysses</em> for a crowd of onlookers. He is Modernism. Roughly fifty pages into the (extremely long) soliloquy, another man runs into the center of the room. His hair is long, possibly dyed some weird color, he&#8217;s wearing a t-shirt with a pun or dirty joke across the front (My boyfriend has one that says &#8220;I Beat Your Mom at Mario Kart&#8221; &#8212; I think that would be sufficient), his pants are baggy, the waistband of his boxer shorts is visible and one shoe drags its laces across the floor as he skids to a stop. Jumping in front of Modernism, the weird guy begins reciting the Gettysburg Address, randomly inserting lines from Jersey Shore. &#8220;Four score and seven years ago, The Situation got fucked up and passed out behind a dumpster.&#8221; That would be Postmodernism. I&#8217;d hang out with that guy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I used to think <em>Oh, my poor, poor professor</em>, but apparently she likes it, so… the weirdness shall continue.</p>
<p>This week we only had to read Baudrillard. She gave us a bit of a reprieve, apparently. A lot of the students, I&#8217;m sure, are a bit put off by both the volume and intensity of the material, and that&#8217;s completely understandable. Half the time I feel like I&#8217;m only absorbing roughly ten percent of everything I read (the easiest stuff, like the skin on top of a Pudding Pak or something) and the rest is skilled tautology, but my professors insist I&#8217;m actually taking in more than I think I am. If they&#8217;re that confident in my ability, I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t stand around after class yelling, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong! I&#8217;m really just faking!&#8221;</p>
<p>My assumption of my own ignorance is apparently a simulacrum, based on my own expectations of being overwhelmed. Snrk.</p>
<p>This week, I used a familiar example in my explanation of Baudrillard:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I had to sum this up (and I really shouldn&#8217;t, seeing as how I&#8217;m still grasping at this like a cruise ship passenger thrown overboard with one of those inflatable doohickeys you can put on your arm), I&#8217;d say my own example would be the first <em>Matrix</em> film. I&#8217;m only going to cite the first since the second was godawful and I never bothered with the third.</p>
<p>In the film, Agent Smith explains to Neo just how the machines managed to control the human populace while imprisoning their bodies in the &#8220;battery factories.&#8221; The first instance of the Matrix, where the machines (with their highly pragmatic and completely unemotional natures preventing them from fully understanding humanity) programmed an idealistic world full of happiness, lacking any sort of conflict or struggle, failed. Their human captives, on an entirely subconscious level, knew that they were inside a simulation. Things were too perfect, too pristine, too easy. It was only when the second instance of the Matrix was developed, an imitation of human life complete with crime, petty egoism and violence was included, that the project became a huge, nearly unbreakable success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Guess which film the rest of the class used to explain Baudrillard? I laughed so hard. We became, for a moment, a bit like a hive mind.</p>
<p>My professor used it, as well, though in a slightly different way. Standing in front of the class, she said, &#8220;Remember that scene in <em>The Matrix</em> where Neo opens a hollowed-out book and removes a disc to give to the guy who shows up at his apartment? Next time you watch the movie, take a look at the book. It&#8217;s <em>Simulacra and Simulation</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to admit that I chuckled a little bit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now two days later, and I have a nearly four-hour gap between classes. I wandered back to my car and left campus, not really sure how to spend my afternoon. I have a thousand pages of Ballard&#8217;s short fiction sitting in my car, so I should have curled up and dug in, but I had a bit of wanderlust. I ended up driving home and hitting up the used video store a few miles away. Four dollars later, I&#8217;m now sitting in front of the TV watching a twelve-year-old film, one that I saw four times in one week when it was in the theatre, just to see a book cover.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the film isn&#8217;t holding me the way it did when I was younger. The, uh, two seconds of Baudrillard were pretty sweet, though.</p>
<p>Edit: You know what still does hold my attention after all these years? <em><strong>This</strong></em> video. What the <strong><em>hell</em></strong>, Jessica? You&#8217;re going to let a bunch of sophomoric fart jokes interfere with your reading/viewing of the nature of simulations?</p>
<p>Yes, yes I am.</p>

<p>I can tell I&#8217;m getting old, because my response to this is &#8220;You know, the farts would be a lot more dramatic and amusing if they just scaled back on them a bit and used them for effect instead of punctuating every single movement and utterance.&#8221; Losing my edge, it seems.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2544" href="http://defiledcurator.com/2011/03/24/elizabeth-taylor-died-today/crash/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2544" title="crash" src="http://defiledcurator.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/crash-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="300" /></a>… in a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/03/23/obit.elizabeth.taylor/index.html?hpt=C2">hospital</a>, far from any limousines.</p>
<p>And what did I do, when I read the news articles about it? I, uh, posted <a href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-xii-crash/">this</a> on Facebook.</p>
<p>One can&#8217;t just shut off one&#8217;s dorkiness. Trust me, I&#8217;ve tried.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Taylor, much like her longtime friend <a href="http://defiledcurator.com/2009/06/29/my-debt-to-michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>, was a bit of a fixture in my life, though on a somewhat smaller scale. As a child, I had no direct interest in her films or complicated romantic life, but my mother and grandmother talked about her in the same way that people still discuss Marilyn Monroe. She was an icon of a glamorous, sexy past that never managed to replicate itself during my growing up years. As she aged, people seemed to talk about her in an almost past-tense sort of way, caught up in a golden age nostalgia.</p>
<p>As I grew older, Elizabeth Taylor seemed to stay in some sort of twilight-of-life stasis. In the past twenty years, it didn&#8217;t seem like she grew any older at all. She remained permanently fixed in the &#8220;aging film star&#8221; stage, occasionally showing up in the news for one thing or another, but mostly remaining in the collective consciousness via showings of her films on TCM and other networks. I never thought about it too deeply, but now that she&#8217;s passed on it seems, almost, as if she wasn&#8217;t quite human. This perspective can be applied to any famous person who dies out of the blue (Michael Jackson, Heath Ledger, Brittany Murphy, et al), but especially for those that maintain amazingly long careers.</p>
<p>Nobody ever expects an icon to die, odd as that may sound.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels to me that if you become a public figure, you trade away your mortality in some kind of Faustian arrangement. I know this to not be true, but it occasionally strikes me as some sort of mirage. Why else would someone give up their privacy, security, anonymity? There has to be some sort of payoff, right?</p>
<p>Most would say that the payoff is fame itself, but to me that feels more like an unwanted burden.</p>
<p>Taylor most recently returned to my active thoughts via J.G. Ballard&#8217;s novel <strong><em>Crash</em></strong>. Yes, yes, I know &#8212; everyone else has already read it. I&#8217;ve said this before, and I&#8217;ll more than likely be repeating it mantra-style for the rest of my life &#8212; <em>last one to the party, last one to the party, last one to the party&#8230;</em></p>
<p>This week&#8217;s topic in Theory was Baudrillard, of all people. As I started reading the section of <em>Simulacra and Simulation</em> concerning Disneyland (&#8220;Adult immaturity? It makes sense, and holy shit is this funny.&#8221;) and the subversive nature of &#8220;scandal,&#8221; I kept wondering where I&#8217;d heard of him before. It wasn&#8217;t until this morning, after reading of Taylor&#8217;s death and scanning Google to see if she&#8217;d ever publicly commented on her role in Ballard&#8217;s most notorious work, that I remembered where I&#8217;d first been introduced to Baudrillard. D&#8217;oh. <em>Ohhhhhh, yeahhhhh… he wrote that essay on <strong>Crash</strong>; it&#8217;s in the same book we excerpted for class.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. That guy. *facepalm*</p>
<p>The more I read Baudrillard, the more I love him, while at the same time the more I find myself becoming spooked as well. I usually reserve post-structuralist and postmodernist analyses, behaviors and attitudes for &#8220;fun time,&#8221; moments when I can toss out a few wordplays or crude jokes and amuse myself or other people via outlandishness. However, the idea of copies of copies of copies and the hyperreal bother me just as much as most Marxist concepts, which I usually fall back on for my more serious analytical work.</p>
<p>Today, one of the few larger than life Hollywood figures has died. If death comes to ageless images, and &#8220;real&#8221; life is modeled off of spoon-fed Hollywood iconography, then we&#8217;re living inside a highly garbled and artifacted copy of a copy of… what, exactly?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost too unnerved to try to find out. Almost.</p>
