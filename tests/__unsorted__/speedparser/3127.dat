So he fired off a tweet jokingly asking &lt;a href="http://www.mortons.com/"&gt;Morton's Steakhouse&lt;/a&gt; to meet him at the airport with a porterhouse steak when he landed. They did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an unbelievable story that only gets more unbelievable once you hear the details. Shankman was tied up in meetings that day and had a flight home that would have pushed his dinner later than he'd like. So he tweeted about it, asking Morton's to meet at the airport with a fat juicy steak. Here's what he said happened after he fired off &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/petershankman/status/103936299983060993"&gt;that joke tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for my driver, I saw my name, waved to him, and started walking to the door of EWR [Newark Airport], like I'd done hundreds of times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Um, Mr. Shankman," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a surprise for you here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to see that the driver was standing next to someone else, who I just assumed was another driver he was talking to. Then I noticed the "someone else" was in a tuxedo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he was carrying a Morton's bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His flight was only two and a half hours long! The closest Morton's was 24 miles away! The man who greeted Shankman at the airport was wearing a tuxedo! (think about that, imagine that guy driving half an hour in a tux with a porterhouse steak in the backseat for a complete stranger.) Inside that Morton's bag was a 24 oz. Porterhouse steak, an order of Colossal shrimp, a side of potatoes, bread, two napkins and silverware. Everything had to go right for Shankman and Morton tuxedo man to meet and Morton's still thought it was worth it to try. A company that cares about customers, what about that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, Shankman is a frequent customer of Morton's (and a man with over 100,000 followers on Twitter) but these are the sort of mini-awesome-miracles that couldn't have happened without Twitter. What an awesome story, I'm totally going to tweet at every restaurant I can think of before I fly now.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/nyregion/grand-central-terminal-retail-success-hurts-old-tenants.html?_r=9to5mac"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is close to approval on the Grand Central Station Apple Store that has been rumored over the past year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Apple proposed opening a store on the balcony overlooking the main hall, it submitted its bid in linen-lined boxes, as if it were a wedding present to transit officials, a source familiar with the application process said. The board is expected to approve the deal as early as next week, at its monthly board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, you're going to delete your subscription. &lt;em&gt;Forever&lt;/em&gt;. Now what? Here's how to replace Netflix in your life, from streaming to shiny plastic discs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what you get with the new Netflix: Unlimited streaming is $8 a month. Unlimited, one-DVD-at-a-time rental is $8 a month. Together, that's now $16 to stream movies and rent discs. Netflix says their streaming library offers 20,000 selections; their DVD library offers over 100,000 shiny pucks. (Whether or not that includes individual TV episodes and DVD discs is unclear. Netflix PR did not reply back to an inquiry.) You also can play videos on a number of home theater devices, including TVs, DVD and Blu-Ray players, iPads, smartphones, and set-top boxes. Plus, you get to use Netflix's awesome queue and recommendation engine, which, to be fair, is underappreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's take a look at the viable alternatives to both the streaming and DVD services. (Options are kept to subscription services, since we assume most people watch/stream more than 10 movies a month. And presumably, you don't need a guide to buy movies a la carte from iTunes or Amazon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:2em"&gt;Premium Streaming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you already order a lot of things from Amazon, the streaming video service appended to Amazon Prime is essentially free gravy. (Amazon Prime costs $80 a year.) Amazon Prime says their library has about 6000 titles, but judging from the ~2000 movies and ~550 TV shows (which are broken down by season), it seems they count individual episodes of TV in that figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as content goes, it's &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; worse than Netflix. Many of the movies offered on Amazon Prime are on Netflix, but Amazon doesn't exactly have the cream of that crop here. And the TV is only attractive if you really love obscure kids cartoons, PBS and old BBC shows. If saving money is really your goal and you already have Amazon Prime, you can do just fine with their streaming video service, even if it isn't spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/07/screen_shot_2011-07-15_at_5.27.45_pm.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/07/500x_screen_shot_2011-07-15_at_5.27.45_pm.jpg" width="500" alt="How to Ditch Netflix and Still Watch (Almost) Everything You Want" title="How to Ditch Netflix and Still Watch (Almost) Everything You Want"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hulu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hulu&amp;#39;s the company that Netflix gotta worry about the most. Hulu&amp;#39;s actually owned by the studios, after all (even if they are sorta kinda trying to sell it). $8 a month gets you unlimited streaming access to roughly 2200 TV shows and 1400 films—Criterion!—many of which are playable on TVs, smartphones, iPads and settop boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to TV, Hulu is way, way better than Netflix. They get most of the current network shows—and some key cable ones—as new episodes air. Plus, they&amp;#39;ve got entire seasons of TV back catalog in their library. There&amp;#39;s also a healthy back archive of old TV shows and anime series in their entirety. The movie selection is pretty mediocre and unexciting, save for one important sub-category: The Criterion Collection. If you&amp;#39;re a classic film buff, there&amp;#39;s enough streaming material here to keep you entertained as you wait for new releases to arrive in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HBO GO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
HBOGO is free, but only if you're an HBO subscriber on cable already, and that means you're already paying $40 a month. But if you're a subscriber, you get access to 300 movies currently airing on HBO, and new ones, like &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; plus over 40 HBO series past and present (&lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;em&gt;Deadwood&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;em&gt;Treme&lt;/em&gt;!), and another 150 titles from their comedy, documentary and sports vaults. The selection is far more limited than any other service (not to mention costly if you're not already an HBO/cable subscriber), but it's also very high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crunchyroll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you mostly watch Anime (and Japanese stuff in general), you'll want Crunchyroll. Alongside Hulu, it's the biggest purveyor of Japanese cartoons, and offers nearly 430 shows in 720p for $7 a month. Plus, it's available on smartphones, Vizio TVs and settop boxes. You're also paying $7 a month for a narrow, but deep, slice of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fandor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What Crunchyroll does for anime, Fandor does for indie films. New films, old films, doesn't matter. Fandor is all about the stuff that major movie studios wouldn't want to touch with a ten foot pole. And while there are some quality films to be found within its 2,500 title catalogue, the service costs $10 a month and the only way to stream content away from a PC is on the Boxee box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:2em"&gt;Free Streaming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/07/screen_shot_2011-07-15_at_5.29.43_pm.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/07/500x_screen_shot_2011-07-15_at_5.29.43_pm.jpg" width="500" alt="How to Ditch Netflix and Still Watch (Almost) Everything You Want" title="How to Ditch Netflix and Still Watch (Almost) Everything You Want"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crackle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Crackle may not have the name recognition of Hulu or Netflix or Amazon, but the Sony-owned company will soon become a force thanks to an embarrassment of exclusive Sony Pictures content and original programming. Moreover, Crackle doesn't cost a cent, and is available on Android (soon), iOS, PS3, Sony TVs and Blu-ray players and settop boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snagfilms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Snagfilms is a treasure trove of free documentaries that you can watch online. It has apps available for the iPad, Boxee and Roku, and films such as MacHeads, We Are Wizards and Heavy Metal Parking Lot are included among its 2100 titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:2em"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockbuster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Blockbuster has been in the movie rental business longer than anyone, and arguably have the strongest industry ties, despite running their business into the ground the past 5 years. In terms of selection, their DVD library is the same as Netflix's on paper (~100,000), and they claim to offer a select number of new releases before the 28-day window that Netflix and Redbox are subject to. But their price isn't the same. A one disc plan costs $12 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, you do have the option of renting games and Blu-ray titles at no extra cost, but if money is the issue, you're not doing yourself any favors by switching plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/07/screen_shot_2011-07-15_at_5.24.49_pm.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2011/07/500x_screen_shot_2011-07-15_at_5.24.49_pm.jpg" width="500" alt="How to Ditch Netflix and Still Watch (Almost) Everything You Want" title="How to Ditch Netflix and Still Watch (Almost) Everything You Want"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Redbox doesn't mail DVDs to your home. Instead, you visit kiosks in over 27,000 locations where you drop and swap discs. Redbox doesn't try and offer every movie. Instead, they have 300 of the newest DVD releases (along with ~50 Blu-ray titles). And Redbox doesn't charge a monthly fee, instead, you pay a single dollar for a one night rental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redbox is trying to invade the Netflix and Blockbuster space by not directly competing. Instead, they have a highly focused library of films (much like HBOGO) and a pricing plan that could work out to be cheaper than Netflix. I mean, how many people can receive, watch, and send back more than 10 movies a month on a single-disc plan? But the downside is that you have to find a kiosk that's conveniently located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="border-top:1px solid lightgray"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might've figured out by now, no matter what you do, you won't be able to get unlimited streaming + DVD rentals for $10 a month anymore. That's the reality. Deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ultimately, you'll want to skip Blockbuster, because it's too pricey for what you're getting. Amazon Prime is fine if you're a regular Amazon user, but it's hardly worth shelling out $80 just for the video service. And HBOGO is great, but if you don't already have HBO is a whole other financial commitment. That leaves you with three real options here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to stick it to Netflix and tell them to piss off, your best bet might be to go with a combination of Redbox and Hulu Plus. You'll get a great mix of new movies, classic movies and TV shows. Depending on how many Redbox films you rent, though, you'll probably be spending anywhere between $10-$17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more freedom of choice, but still want to show Netflix you're pissed, maybe you just go DVD-only and instead sign up for Hulu Plus, which has better TV offerings and is available on many of the same devices. It will still cost you the same, but you know, you're rebelling. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you just want Netflix streaming to get better, cancel your DVD plan and go with Redbox. Netflix wants more people streaming because it's cheaper, and it's a valid argument to think that if more people throw their support behind streaming technologies, networks and studios will be forced to deliver content that way. What's your plan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion is in the midst of a major transition in every sense of the word. Publicly, the company is portraying a very defensive image — one that is very dismissive, as if RIM is profitable and class-leading, and the media is out of line to criticize its business, as are investors. Internally, however, there’s a different story to be told. It’s a story filled with attitude, cockiness, heated arguments among the executive team and Co-CEOs, and paranoia. We’ve spoken to multiple ex-RIM executives at length about their experiences with the company over the past few years. While most speak highly of RIM and their time in Waterloo, they also each left the company due mainly to RIM’s lack of vision and leadership. Read on for an exclusive inside look at a company teetering on the edge between greatness and collapse.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:40%;float:right;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;Lightning in a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lightning in a bottle.” That is how one former executive described Research In Motion in its early days. “This came together at the right time, the right place, with the right technology, and Jim and Mike are extremely brilliant individuals.” Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis are two irreplaceable leaders who were largely responsible for RIM’s success, our source continued. But as time progressed, Mike did not listen to the marketplace. This is obvious from the outside view, though the details surrounding why RIM is no longer a market leader — and why RIM will most likely not be able to regain its leadership position in the near future — are most interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewind a few years. Picture yourself sitting in an executive briefing at Research In Motion. You’d hear Mike Lazaridis unequivocally state time and time again that BlackBerry smartphones would never have MP3 players or cameras in them because it just does not make sense when the company’s primary customers were the government and enterprise. “BlackBerry smartphones will never have cameras because the No. 1 customer of ours is the U.S. government,” Mike Lazaridis would say in meetings. “There will never be a BlackBerry with an MP3 player or camera.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:50%;float:left;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;There will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be a BlackBerry with an MP3 player or camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, that RIM didn’t only miss the boat in terms of product features and device trends as we now know, but the underpinnings of the company’s consumer failure began all the way back in 2005 with bold statements like these, combined with a lack of research and development in numerous key areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Lazaridis would say that the most ridiculous idea was to name a phone with a marketing-derived name, like the &lt;em&gt;Motorola RAZR&lt;/em&gt;. “BlackBerry will never do that, it will always be a model number,” he said to executives. “A BlackBerry with a name is ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here we are, as young, brazen people, and we’re just like, ‘Mike, you’re missing out. There’s a trend here; it’s a social and collaborative scene in certain media circles’,” one former executive said, describing the general feeling among other executives at the company. “Now look at what’s happened 4 or 5 years later — an MP3 player, camera, name, all done reluctantly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I would work with our major carriers, I would have to go to Mike’s product development team, and ask what are we going to bring to [redacted],” and it was never a cutting edge product, one former executive told me. There wasn’t ever a three-year roadmap. Mike was always focused on small, granular features like how to make the speakerphone in a BlackBerry the best speakerphone on the market. Mike would say that people were going to buy a BlackBerry because of the speakerphone… “because they wouldn’t need a Polycom anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-year roadmap for RIM products focused on refining the technology in phones had already been released, rather than looking at where to add major new componentry or trying to identify or even shape future trends. “One of the main reasons RIM missed the mark with the browser was because&lt;br&gt;
they were always proud of how little data usage a user would use,” a former executive said. “There was no three-year plan at RIM.” RIM would be proud of the fact that someone would only use 1MB of data in a month in 2005, and as a result, there wasn’t ever any extensive R&amp;amp;D done within the browser space. Over time, that misstep affected BlackBerry tremendously as competing devices began to deliver desktop-like Web experiences. “Mike Lazaridis couldn’t imagine that consumers would be spending hours watching and streaming video to their devices, he couldn’t understand it,” the former exec continued. This is why we don’t see RIM excelling in spaces like camera technology, or displays — because the company never even attempted to anticipate the smartphone trends we’re seeing today. “RIM is a reactionary company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:35%;float:right;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;A BlackBerry with a name is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember going to sit with the CMO of one of the largest wireless carriers, and we would deliver features like “increase battery life by 40%” in the next model, and we would get a blank look on the other side of the conference room. The executives would think, ‘so your telling me with this device I am going to sell 40% less car chargers’, there was a blank stare. “They want the flavor of the week, and the carrier’s loyalty is to their customers and what their customers want. Then try and delivery that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike is really brilliant, and superior beyond his years, and what he’s doing with Stephen Hawking and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics is compelling,” he continued. “There are hundreds of millions he’s put into it, but that doesn’t have anything to do with what RIM’s facing, and what’s in front of them, and the market is asking for them to change their ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;“Back a handful of years ago, if someone had a phone at work that wasn’t a BlackBerry they paid for it,” another executive who no longer works at Research In Motion said. “I was at a Fortune 500 organization a few weeks ago, and people were carrying a corporate issued BlackBerry in their left pocket and their own personal iPhone in the right pocket.” He continued, “The fact that people are spending their own money to buy the iPhone, when their company is giving them a ‘free BlackBerry’ sends quite a message to RIM,” says one of our sources.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:50%;float:left;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;The market is asking for them to change their ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were both stunned that someone could have a corporate-issued phone that could handle some consumer needs, but still walk around with two devices. There were and are many paradigms at RIM. In the corporate world, especially at large companies, the senior executives would buy a BlackBerry as soon as it came out. They would then give their old devices to employees beneath them, and these BlackBerry phones would eventually make their way down through the corporation. This isn’t the case anymore, and now those people that used to receive the hand-me-down BlackBerry devices are asking for shiny new phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and Mike got along very well, I was told by multiple current and former RIM employees. The interesting thing, however, is that when they have disagreements, Mike wins all of the internal arguments. “Jim, given his background, doesn’t have the pedigree to compete with Mike on an academic level.” As a result, perhaps, I was told that things have slowly deteriorated between the two co-CEOs. Jim and Mike have “titanic” arguments in the halls of RIM headquarters on various subjects, and we’re told it’s quite open. Stories of explosive fights bleeding out into the hallways and even lunch spots in Waterloo have filled Research In Motion. It used to be that only vice presidents or above would get the privilege of listening to Mike and Jim debate — behind closed doors or in the boardroom. Regular employees now hear the arguments as well, and “they aren’t insulated for that. It’s unnerving. It makes for a nervous environment, and many employees are looking to jump ship. Most people are just uncertain as to what the future holds [for RIM].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:53%;float:right;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;Most people are just uncertain as to what the future holds for RIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you hear Mike talk about the latest and greatest, it’s been the same thing for ten years: security, battery performance, and network performance. RIM has positioned battery life and network performance for years. People are not concerned with iPhone battery life,” one source told me. Network performance, to Mike, trumps any innovation a device like the iPhone offers. “Mike is convinced people won’t buy an iPhone because battery life isn’t as good as a BlackBerry,” a different source said. Mike apparently is in disbelief that people can use over 15GB of data on their iPhone and Android devices, and he feels that people will buy smartphones based on network efficiency, even though carriers with tiered data plans in developed markets love customers who use monstrous amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While RIM has always viewed carriers as customers rather than end users, carriers have long been trying to find a different partner that doesn’t charge network fees. Since all BlackBerry devices use the BlackBerry NOC, RIM gets a piece of the data plan users pay on their bills each month. And RIM is the only manufacturer whose products are configured in such a way. “Carriers have always tried to negotiate the fees they pay RIM. They try everything to get that dropped or lowered, but that has been the one holy grail of RIM that has not been touched. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ex-executive who had been responsible for a number of  carrier partners for RIM recently told me that the data network fees paid to RIM were definitely the number one cause of heartburn from carriers, and a big point of contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:35%;float:left;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;There was no three- year plan at RIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at RIM’s global revenue today, the story it paints isn’t a good one as far as driving new business and revenue channels. “They essentially just channel stuff,” a former exec said. For instance, when RIM wants to sell to a new market, it will go to two or three primary carriers and make those carriers purchase a set amount of devices up front to stock the channel for what is typically the remainder of the calendar year. Then RIM will sell those devices at full margin. It’s a great quick and easy profit from the channel. So RIM has now opened up three new carriers in a new country, let’s say, and it had them each purchase “X” thousand units each. Now, RIM can report to the Street that it shipped 700,000 devices at full market value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After multiple sequential quarters of opening up new countries, there’s obviously a lot of volume there. Though the consensus of many is that RIM is nearing capacity with this strategy. The company now has to rely on the old school model of growth within these existing channels, and just as we’re seeing in North America with the tide changing now that long-standing BlackBerry customers are moving to other platforms and devices, that will happen in countries outside of the U.S. and Canada that have been stuffed with BlackBerry phones. Growth will slow to a stall in these markets, one source told me, and the problems will be compounded by the fact that a lot of these devices are not being sold through to end users. “They’re selling a screen with a giant calculator attached to it. It’s not a cool device anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the PlayBook is concerned, RIM’s initial 500,000 shipments weren’t even sold at full margin. “RIM’s thought process was that they hoped if they put a product in a carrier’s hands that was less than full margin, it would entice the carriers to apply whatever number of discounts against that to bring it to market at an even lower price — a subsidy on the tablet. RIM isn’t making any money on the PlayBook.” To complicate matters, however, Jim Balsillie told the carriers at the 11th hour that the PlayBook wouldn’t have native email and would require the Bridge app in order to receive emails and provide calendar functions. “RIM is notorious for dropping these bombshells at the 11th hour on the carriers, and the PlayBook not having native email was a shock to the carriers.” They were all expecting a BlackBerry with a bigger screen. RIM was hoping to blow through the 500,000 units and have carriers take orders for millions of additional PlayBooks, but that has not happened yet. Mike Lazaridis looks at it as, &lt;em&gt;why aren’t people buying this tablet when it has the most powerful engine with respect to multitasking, and supports Flash?&lt;/em&gt; But consumers have spoken pretty loudly a number of times, and Mike unfortunately leads the product side and continues to miss the mark with the masses, a former RIM executive told me. “I don’t even see anyone in Waterloo walking around with a PlayBook that doesn’t work for RIM,” another former RIM employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:59%;float:right;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;Mike is convinced people won’t buy an iPhone because it doesn’t have a battery as good as a BlackBerry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People really think Mike has lost his touch and vision. He’s paranoid. It’s not uncommon to see him walking around campus with bodyguards in tow,” one source told me. “This is a small community of folks in Waterloo. There’s what? 100,000 people and 30,000 of them are students, and it’s an understated place. Sure there are millionaires but no one drives anything fancier than a 5-series BMW. For Mike to be on campus with bodyguards is very peculiar. It’s very Orson Wells-like.” Another former employee I spoke with doesn’t find the fact that Lazaridis has bodyguards to be odd at all due to his stature. RIM’s other Co-CEO, however, is a completely different person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every year, Jim Balsillie and COO Dennis Kavelman would take all the executives to Redtail golf course for a day of R&amp;amp;R with great meals, great VIP service, and every year one executive would not ever go.” Mike could not understand why everyone would go and have a golf day. In fact, he supposedly hated it and he never showed up on purpose, I was told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jim chasing the NHL teams, that caused some separation between Mike and Jim,” one former executive stated. When Jim was in the midst of buying an NHL team, the NHL hired a large group to work on the project, and it had countless former RIM executives called for testimony on what Jim Balsillie was really like — all of the “TMZ dirt,” as one source described it. One executive BGR spoke to refused to talk to the NHL when they reached out, however many others were happy to open up. While this former exec did not have an issue with Jim, it was hypothesized that those with an axe to grind lobbed some dirt at the NHL and it’s most likely one of the reasons they didn’t allow him to proceed with a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:63%;float:left;color:#03316a"&gt;
&lt;p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:0.9em"&gt;They’re selling a screen with a giant calculator attached to it. It’s not a cool device anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple former executives also spoke of a notable divide between Mike, an internal product guy, and Jim, who focuses more on external partner relationships, in how they each react to leaks from inside the company. “I remember this one time when we had a new device coming out and it leaked to BGR.” Mike lost his mind for a few weeks. He couldn’t fathom how something like this would happen, and he constantly threatened to fire any employees who leaked any information. “He had this ‘you’re either with us or against us’ attitude, and he went off the rails. Every product is Mike’s baby”. On the other hand, Jim would try and spin things, I was told. He would get everyone excited, “you know, here it comes, he’d roll with it and have the attitude that they’re boosting the hype of the device, they’re pre-selling it for us, and so on. That was the message Jim would take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM seems to be doing damage control in a bunch of areas right now. One such area is the PlayBook and trying to mitigate the negative response to that product, and I was told the company is even going so far as to selectively block different media and even social networking sites from being accessed by employees. One of my sources said he anticipates RIM always having a niche market in the enterprise and government spaces, but he doesn’t think RIM has the potential to become a true market leader with consumers due to several shortfalls. “You’d honestly think RIM is more than a year or two behind in [the consumer market],” one source told me. “There will most likely be another heavy reduction in the workplace later this year or early next year.

&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not going to knock any socks off this year, but Apple has finally kicked off its annual back to school sale. A day behind schedule, Apple on Thursday announced that students making qualifying Mac purchases will receive a complimentary $100 iTunes gift card. The offer applies to college students and those accepted into college, and any MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac or Mac Pro purchase will qualify for the gift card. Apple’s promotion this year offers less than half the back-for-your-buck compared to past promotions that offered a free iPod touch with each purchase, but $100 toward software for your new Mac computer on top of a 10% student discount still makes for a decent deal. Apple’s offer runs from now through September 20th, so students have more than enough time to wait for that &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/14/refreshed-macbook-air-expected-later-this-month/"&gt;imminent MacBook Air refresh&lt;/a&gt; we’ve all been expecting.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Apple is poised to refresh its popular thin and light MacBook Air family later this month. The news outlet cited a report from Taiwan’s Economic Daily, which suggested that Apple’s first shipment will include 380,000 of the new Air units. The report is in line with earlier rumors suggesting supplies of the &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/05/31/macbook-air-in-short-supply-as-refresh-nears/"&gt;MacBook Air were drying up&lt;/a&gt; nearing a possible refresh; one analyst with Concord Securities recently &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/04/25/apple-may-refresh-macbook-air-family-in-june/"&gt;suggested that Apple will upgrade its MacBook Air family in June&lt;/a&gt;, too. The new models are expected to carry Intel’s Sandy Bridge CPUs, new Thunderbolt I/O ports, and improved Intel graphics. Apple &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2010/10/20/apple-unveils-new-macbook-air-models/"&gt;last refreshed its MacBook Air family&lt;/a&gt; on October 20th, 2010.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple, a company many said had repeatedly delayed the development and launch of the iPhone for fear that it might cannibalize its iPod business, is now a “mobile devices company” with a smartphone that is undoubtedly its flagship device. Chief Executive Steve Jobs and Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook have both publicly acknowledged this major transition on several occasions, including on stage while unveiling the iPad and on earnings calls while speaking with analysts. Apple is growing at an unheard of pace and stockpiling mountains of cash, all thanks to its mobile business. Personal Computers, Apple’s core business for nearly 30 years, now play second fiddle to the company’s mobile devices in terms of both revenue and mind share. On the other side of the table, old rival Microsoft is doing all it can to regain its footing in the mobile space after letting its Windows Mobile platform grow stale and moldy. Windows Mobile’s replacement, Windows Phone, is still in its infancy but early reports have suggested adoption has been slow at best. So where does Microsoft go from here?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet erupted following our report covering industry insider Eldar Murtazin’s claim that &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/01/microsoft-strikes-deal-to-acquire-nokias-phone-business-insider-claims/"&gt;Microsoft has struck a deal to purchase Nokia’s cell phone business for $19 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Murtazin has a long track record of solid Nokia scoops, and he was &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2010/12/20/murtazin-nokia-to-build-windows-phone-7-devices/"&gt;the first person to report&lt;/a&gt; that the Finnish phone maker would adopt Microsoft’s Windows Phone platform for its smartphones starting later this year. While his new claim is anything but confirmed, it’s not as far fetched as some might think. In fact, a deal to dump Nokia’s phone business could actually be considered a continuation of former Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-Nokia chief lead a major reorganization that began several years ago in an effort to transition the company away from being a devices company. Instead, Kallasvuo believed Nokia’s future was in software and services. Subsequent acquisitions of companies like Navteq and the eventual launch of Nokia’s Ovi suite would set the phone maker on this new course, but the transition came at a time when the company’s smartphones were leapfrogged by Android and iOS devices, and revenue began to sink along with the firm’s market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps Nokia was on the right track. Perhaps Kallasvuo’s vision of Nokia as a software company is shared by new CEO Stephen Elop, who some pundits believe was brought on board solely to preside over a union with Microsoft, his former employer. Those pundits were painted as conspiracy theorists until &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/02/11/official-nokia-to-adopt-windows-phone-as-smartphone-operating-system-live-video/"&gt;Nokia announced this past February that it would adopt Windows Phone&lt;/a&gt; as its smartphone platform of the future. Was that deal just the beginning? It’s not so crazy to imagine a role reversal of sorts, where Microsoft could orchestrate the bigger picture while Nokia supplies the software and services that power the Windows Phone platform. Plenty of companies have built monstrous businesses by supplying software to hardware makers — one such company, of course, is Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft is a different story right now. It is a PC OS company at its core, and therein lies the problem: the PC OS business isn’t what it used to be. As such, Microsoft has spent a considerable amount of time and resources fanning out its software and service portfolio in order to spread out its net. It’s doing a good job, all things considered, but one company found a better path to take not long ago. That company is Apple, and that path is mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would certainly be quite an interesting piece of irony. For years, Apple nipped at Microsoft’s heels while chasing the Redmond-based giant’s computer business. Then in 2007, Apple planted seeds that would sprout into one of the most successful technology ventures of recent history: iOS. The iPhone, the iPad, the iPod touch… a trio of mobile devices that have made Apple one of the biggest technology companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spent decades trying to &lt;em&gt;become the next Microsoft&lt;/em&gt;. Now, from atop a mountain of mobile devices, Apple may finally be able to sit and watch while Microsoft tries to &lt;em&gt;become the next Apple&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zach Epstein</name></author><gr:likingUser>01272876345164359480</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>09803098588727110477</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>17252568258677848776</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>14475085632473727612</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>07167945503456896994</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>13411893622738288242</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>15278950954492255140</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>14349407570166849799</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>12280570659847858896</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>14571455275075785300</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>09266834277631767753</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>18197740506206681142</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>05651871339482349905</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>00320933387269203904</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.boygeniusreport.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.boygeniusreport.com/feed/</id><title type="html">BGR: The Three Biggest Letters In Tech</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.bgr.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1306944584953"><id gr:original-id="Gizmodo-5807388">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee4c45a753857017</id><category term="unconfirmed"/><category term="Microsoft"/><category term="Microsoft buys nokia"/><category term="Nokia"/><category term="Phones"/><category term="Smartphones"/><category term="Wp7"/><title type="html">Uh, Did Microsoft Just Buy Nokia's Phone Business?

But the same Russian blogger who's been &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/eldarmurtazin/status/75664430670680065"&gt;kicking up dirt&lt;/a&gt; about Microsoft buying Nokia for the last couple weeks now says done deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rumored and solidly weird megadeal would have the software giant buying the hardware giant for $19 billion, and comes just months after Nokia forsook its in-house Symbian OS to &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5757649/nokia-and-microsoft-are-officially-new-bffs"&gt;put WP7 on its handsets&lt;/a&gt;. We're skeptical! Despite its hard-earned Xbox success, Microsoft is a software company at heart, one that thrives on sowing licenses far and wide like a digital Johnny Appleseed. That's why a software deal with Nokia makes perfect sense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But locking up with a flailing hardware company whose bread and butter is &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5638995/nokia-is-the-mcdonalds-of-phones"&gt;cheap and disposable dumbphones&lt;/a&gt; doesn't seem to make much sense for Microsoft. And a Nokia spokesperson had already &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/05/16/microsoft-to-buy-nokias-phone-division-not-likely/"&gt;pretty much shut down&lt;/a&gt; previous rumors of this exact nature.

&lt;p&gt;BBM is one of the most compelling aspects of the BlackBerry experience — could Apple be set to bring their own instant messaging service to iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad… via Twitter? MG Siegler said yesterday that Apple was going to be including Twitter image posting in &lt;a href="http://www.tipb.com/tag/ios-5"&gt;iOS 5&lt;/a&gt; and John Gruber added that &lt;a href="http://www.tipb.com/2011/05/31/ios-5-include-deep-systemwide-twitter-integration/"&gt;the integration could be much broader, and at the system level&lt;/a&gt;. Then Siegler fired back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While Anil Dash wonders if Apple could make their own Twitter, I just think it would be great if Apple would create (or buy) any type of messaging services that bypasses SMS. It’s such a colossal rip off. And out of date. And it continues to empower the carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a reason why BBM took off. Apple could make it work device-to-device as well. I’m thinking we need a FaceTime without the “Face”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big problem with BBM is that, so far, it’s locked to the BlackBerry platform. Twitter is cross platform. Sure, it’s still proprietary, like Whatsapp, Kik, and other BBM alternatives, but the user base is huge. Dieter and I spoke about this, and there are still a lot of questions, of course. Twitter has had problems with scaling and being the BBM of iOS would be a lot of scale. Could Apple’s Data Center help with that? Also, Twitter doesn’t currently have group messages. Would they need them? Would partnering with Apple help Twitter bring those features to market faster? Would it then roll out across other platforms, paving the way for a real, universal communications protocol?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, there are a lot of questions, but as Siegler points out, Twitter is free, while SMS isn’t. That makes for a rather elegant end run around carriers and their obscene SMS prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has relied on Google for Maps, YouTube, and search in the past. Could they rely on Twitter for text communications in the future? Would you want them to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to industry insider Eldar Murtazin, Microsoft has struck a deal to purchase Nokia’s mobile phone business for $19 billion. Just two weeks ago, Murtazin — who has a proven track record and was the first to report that Nokia has struck a deal to use Microsoft’s Windows Phone platform on its smartphones — &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/05/16/nokia-may-consider-sale-of-phone-unit-to-microsoft/"&gt;suggested that Microsoft and Nokia were about to enter closed-door meetings&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate a possible purchase that could close sometime before the end of this year. It could make sense: Nokia’s CEO is former Microsoft executive Stephen Elop, and the two companies have already reached a deal to create new Windows Phone devices, a dozen of which are expected to launch next year. We’ll have to see how this pans out, but a Nokia spokesperson had already addressed Murtazin’s earlier claims, saying “Eldar’s rumors are getting obviously less accurate with every passing moment.” Nokia declined to comment on Murtazin’s claim this time around.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Johnny&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February we heard early reports that Apple was planning to construct an &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/02/17/worlds-largest-apple-store-coming-to-grand-central-station/"&gt;Apple Store inside Grand Central&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of New York City. A month later &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/21/apples-grand-central-terminal-store-a-no-go-report-claims/"&gt;new reports suggested that the plan was scrapped&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, however, Apple is interested in two balconies that are located on the north and east sides of Grand Central Terminal — a total of 15,230 square feet. BGR has also independently confirmed that Apple has indeed been scoping out the space during the past few weeks. A restaurant currently occupies one of the areas up for rent, but it’s expected to close its doors on July 1st, which would presumably allow Apple to start construction later this summer. According to some experts speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the store could have the potential to be Apple’s most popular retail location to date. The MTA is expected to issue a request for proposals on Monday.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Seriously! Shine is a beaut, when you bring it up, it gives the current weather in clear text with an enjoyable cartoon graphic. The bottom displays the forecast (which is side swipeable to see the rest of the 7 days) with high/low temperatures, precipitation and again, enjoyable cartoon graphic. It keeps things simple and to the point. Not for weather nerds, though. $1.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are our favorite parts of iOS that outdo their Android counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#e2e0d4;padding:16px;margin:16px 8px 16px 8px"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A note on flame wars&lt;/b&gt;: We love Android (which should be pretty evident by now). Despite everything mentioned in this post, nobody is (or should be) arguing iOS is better than Android (or the other way around). They both have their strengths and weaknesses, and a lot comes down to personal preference. Most of us love our smartphones and mobile devices, because they're pretty great, but it's good to &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5801862/top-10-awesome-android-features-that-the-iphone-doesnt-have"&gt;look at both sides&lt;/a&gt; as what you use may not be the best thing to recommend to somebody else. Discussing the merits of each platform is useful for that reason, but bashing either Android or iOS is not. So, please keep the flame wars to a minimum in the comments.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;10. The iTunes Media Store&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/05/photo-12.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/05/500x_photo-12.jpg" width="500" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; While iOS still doesn't allow you to sync wirelessly, you can, at least, use your Wi-Fi (and in some cases cellular data) connection to purchase and download music, video, and books over the air. While Android's not without Amazon's media offerings, Apple gives you access to an enormous library of entertainment that you can purchase in a few taps. Everything you buy is sent to it corresponding app and transferred over to your computer the next time you sync. The process is seamless. When it comes to buying media for your device, there's really no better implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Personal note: I greatly prefer Amazon to iTunes for several reasons, but I think that Apple's implementation of the iTunes store is far better because of how simple and well-integrated it is.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;9. AirPlay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/05/youtube-apple-ios-airplay1-642x325.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/05/500x_youtube-apple-ios-airplay1-642x325.jpg" width="500" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5700741/the-airplay+alternative-guide-to-streaming-your-media"&gt;plenty of alternatives to Apple's AirPlay&lt;/a&gt;, but none that work quite so elegantly and intuitively. Out of the box, AirPlay doesn't really seem all that useful if you don't own other Apple devices but there are actually &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5802958/how-to-make-your-entire-home-airplay+compatible"&gt;several ways to make your non-Apple devices AirPlay compatible&lt;/a&gt;. Two-tap video streaming that actually works really well is pretty great, and you won't find such a nice solution on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;8. Find My iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/05/find-my-iphone.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/find-my-iphone.jpg" width="340" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It's not like you can't &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5611003/build-a-find-my-iphone-clone-for-android"&gt;roll your own device-tracking setup on Android&lt;/a&gt;, but now that Find My iPhone (or iPad or iPod touch) is free it&amp;#39;s no longer the best paid option—it&amp;#39;s just the best. It&amp;#39;s simple to use, it&amp;#39;s easy to track your phone, and it has even helped people catch criminals when the loss was a result of theft (like &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/13312813?messageID=13312813&amp;amp;tstart=0"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.davelongstrethmusic.com/?p=121"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, for example). It's been proven effective and costs you nothing. There's not much more you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;7. A Better Support System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/genius-bar.jpg" width="158" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt; What happens if your Android phone breaks? There are a few answers to that question, but often times it means dealing with your specific carrier. They didn&amp;#39;t make your phone and they have many different kinds of devices to support. Neither of those things are in your favor. What about your iPhone or other iDevice? You take it to an Apple Store or call Apple tech support. Often times you can make a Genius Bar appointment and get your issue resolved right away (assuming that problem isn&amp;#39;t the total obliteration of the hardware). If you&amp;#39;ve ever tried to get tech support at a Verizon store, for example, you know how frustrating that can be. Apple&amp;#39;s support team—while not perfect—is one of the best there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;6. Better Battery Life and Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/iphone_battery.jpg" width="340" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt; Over the past few years, Apple's started to consider battery life to be one of the most important features of its products. This is especially evident in the iPad, which contains around as much battery as humans contain water, but it's also Apple's battery management tactics that make this possible. Some may be disappointed that the lack of true multitasking is lost in the name of power economy, but true multitasking isn't all that great when you device dies because it ran out of juice. While it didn't start off that way, the latest batch of devices running iOS will get you through the day (and sometimes longer). That's not always something you can count on with Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;5. iTunes and Tethered Syncing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/itunes-store.jpg" width="340" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt; iTunes is a behemoth of a media manager but it handles &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of data as it goes from your computer to your iDevice and back again. It has an enormous amount of responsibility for those who do sync with their computers. You can certainly argue that &lt;a href="http://www.doubletwist.com"&gt;DoubleTwist&lt;/a&gt; brings the features of iTunes to Android, but the fact of the matter is that an application needed to be created to &lt;em&gt;bring iTunes to Android&lt;/em&gt;. Android is missing iTunes in the same way iOS is missing Android's wireless capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Personal note: &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5674772/never-sync-your-iphone-with-itunes-again"&gt;I really don't like iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it's hard to argue that there's anything that does what it does as well. It is a very ambitious piece of software that doesn't work as well as I'd like it to, but I do appreciate the difficulty of creating something like it. While there are definitely other great music players, there really isn't anything else that can do everything iTunes can do (even if it often fails to do some of those things well).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;4. No Crapware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/crapware.jpg" width="500" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt; Sure, you can pick up the Nexus S and get a phone with no added applications and have an Android phone without any crapware added by the manufacturer, but most people aren't getting their Android phones from Google. When you buy your Android phone from a particular carrier, you can often to expect a few apps you won't want and can't get rid of. With iOS you just get iOS. While &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5541049/remains-of-the-day-freedom-from-porn-edition"&gt;Apple might be a little overprotective at times&lt;/a&gt;, their walled garden is not without its upsides. It's nice buying an iDevice with the knowledge you won't get stuck with a Sprint NASCAR app you don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;3. A Bigger and Better Variety of Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/apps.png" width="340" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt; While the iTunes App Store is never going to sell classic game console emulators and other questionable apps—and that&amp;#39;s a shame—there is, on average, more money to make when developing for iOS. The downside is that most apps cost a bit of money, but it&amp;#39;s rarely more than a couple of dollars. The upside is that developers who make money are more likely to be able to afford to spend time developing. The gold mine that is the iTunes App Store has also attracted plenty of big name game developers who&amp;#39;ve brought some pretty amazing titles to iOS. Sometimes a little money can go a long way, and it does with apps. iOS has some of the most elegant, polished, fun, and even useful apps. They may be a bit more restricted than Android apps, but it&amp;#39;s not like you can&amp;#39;t &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5771943/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-jailbreaking-your-ios-device"&gt;jailbreak&lt;/a&gt; if you're looking for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;2. A Well-Designed, Intuitive User Interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="lytebox" href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/05/interface.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/interface.jpg" width="340" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Whether you like Apple's hardware and software or not, it's hard to argue that they aren't beautifully designed. Apple puts a lot of thought in the design of the interface, from its looks to its ease of use. iOS' user experience is one of the most intuitive. Android can take some time to figure out, and there's a lack of consistency in the way third-party apps operate, but if you give someone an iOS device they'll generally be able to figure out much of the functionality on their own. People are &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGMsT4qNA-c"&gt;posting videos of their very young children using iPads&lt;/a&gt;. Android ends up with &lt;a href="http://fuglyandroid.tumblr.com/"&gt;sites like this&lt;/a&gt; (which isn't representative of the platform and a bit much, but still makes a point). iOS is nice to look at and easy to learn, welcoming pretty much everyone to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="font-size:120%;margin-top:20px"&gt;1. Consistency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2011/05/fragmented-android.jpg" width="158" alt="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android" title="Top 10 Ways iOS Outdoes Android"&gt; iOS is nothing if not consistent. When you pick up an iOS device, you know exactly what you're getting. This shouldn't come as a surprise from a company like Apple, who likes to control every aspect of their products. When it comes to receiving major feature updates, you get them on a fairly regular schedule. While there's some update fragmentation with iOS, it's only ever been between phones and tablets. With Android, it's between the many, many different phones &lt;em&gt;as well as&lt;/em&gt; fragmentation between phones and tablets. Knowing what you're getting and that you'll be receiving updates for at least the next two generations of devices increases the value of an iDevice long past the date of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Then, I did some research.  By all accounts, and what I have seen, this guy can play the game of&lt;a href="http://www.giantsfootballblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SASH.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Orange Bowl - Iowa v Georgia Tech" src="http://www.giantsfootballblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SASH.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sash is the type of player the Giants need in their secondary and on special teams: heady, tough and motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passages below are from the Iowa Football blog &lt;strong&gt;Black Heart, Gold Pants…..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He was the most decorated safety at Iowa since Bob Sanders roamed the secondary and instilled fear in Big Ten receivers…Like most multi-year starters at safety at Iowa, Sash was a well-rounded player, adept at both shutting down the run and putting the clamps down on passing attacks.  But of those two, he was better against the pass; Sash had an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time to knock down passes or to pluck an errant pass out of the air and go racing downfield with it.  He also seemed to have an amazing knack at making big plays at big moments…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For much of his Iowa career, he had an incredible ability to be exactly where he needed to be in order to make big plays; it can’t all have been sheer coincidence or pure luck.  Aside from his near-magical big play abilities, Sash also possessed good coverage skills (he was rarely beaten deep or the source of broken coverages that gave up big pass plays), and was solid against the run…..It doesn’t hurt Sash’s case that Iowa has put a slew of safeties into the NFL under Kirk Ferentz — Derek Pagel, Sean Considine, and Bob Sanders all had (or continue to have) multi-year NFL careers and even Marcus Paschal hung around the NFL for quite a while….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These elements did not get past the Giants. They used their first of two compensatory selections in Round Six to grab Sash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003366"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This guy has good size, he runs good enough,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” said Marc Ross, the Giants’ director of college scouting. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#003366"&gt;“He is not your top-flight athlete, but the guy has a feel for the game — instinctive, excellent ball skills….We hope he will play special teams for us. He has that kind of toughness about him, reckless with his body. So we really like that about him.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a folk legend in Iowa, Sash is fully cognizant of his roots and is active in giving back to the community.  Last week, Sash helped raise $22k to help a local cancer patient……&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kcci.com/video/27566428/detail.html"&gt;WATCH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes, you want a business card that's about you, not the company that employs you. Thankfully, About.me, &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5714529/aboutme-creates-a-personal-landing-page-in-dead-simple-steps"&gt;one of our favorite personal landing page services&lt;/a&gt;, is willing to send you some. You just pay shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, a personal business card is exactly what you need. It can tell a new acquaintance, client, or potential employer about you personally, and give them a way to reach you that's not routed through your office phone or your corporate e-mail account, and if you're a happy office worker that does freelance work on the side, having different business cards for different encounters can be a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, About.me and Moo, a Web-based custom printing company, have partnered up to let About.me users design business cards based on their profiles. The new cards have your profile image on the front, and on the back they feature your name, your About.me profile URL and e-mail address (if you choose,) and a QR code. The people you give your card to can scan the QR code to visit your About.me profile right there on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can customize the card to include a headline, a phone number, or any other information you want that's not normally included. Since the cards are free, there's a Moo logo on the bottom, but you can have it removed if you pay a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of About.me's goals is to give people a Web-based business card they can point anyone to. The business cards are a natural extension of the idea, and it doesn't hurt that they're willing to print 50 of them for free and send them to you – as long as you pay $5.50 shipping. If you don't have an About.me landing page, you can sign up for free to take advantage of the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally there’s a reason for young people to use&lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com"&gt; LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;! If you’re having trouble keeping track of where your friends work in this current &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/24/were-in-the-middle-of-a-terrible-blubble/"&gt;startupgasm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.whoworks.at"&gt;WhoWorks.At&lt;/a&gt; was made for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just download the &lt;a href="http://www.whoworks.at"&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; and it will let you know who in your LinkedIn network works at whatever site you’re currently browsing in Chrome, whether it be Facebook, Google, TechCrunch or some stealth startup. It is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click on the &lt;a href="http://www.whoworks.at"&gt;Whoworks.at&lt;/a&gt; button at the right of your Chrome toolbar, your first 1st degree LinkedIn connections will show up first, followed by your 2nd and 3rd level connections. You can also toggle the extension to view people who have been recently hired or promoted at the company you’re visiting. I’m not kidding, this is a godsend if you’re a recruiter or a &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/tech-press-screw-them-all/"&gt;journalist/investor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creator John Britton, who is also a developer evangelist at&lt;a href="http://www.twilio.com"&gt; Twilio&lt;/a&gt;, plans on integrating Whoworks.at with other services including Facebook and Rapportive, which was the inspiration behind the service. Interestingly enough, Whoworks.at doesn’t use a public LinkedIn search API (non-existant despite &lt;a href="http://developer.linkedin.com/thread/2993"&gt;high demand&lt;/a&gt;), but instead finds its connections through the searchbox on LinkedIn that auto completes company names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Britton on his future plans, &lt;em&gt;“I’ve been in contact with the founders of Rapportive and they’ve put me on their beta list. As soon as they have public APIs available I plan to enhance the functionality of &lt;a href="http://WhoWorks.At/"&gt;WhoWorks.At&lt;/a&gt; to be less dependent on LinkedIn. Additionally I would like to add the ability to star people, view recent gmail conversations, and take notes on contacts. Facebook integration will come further down the line, depending on user feedback.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, Facebook integration …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who can’t wait, invites for the first 250 TechCrunch readers are available &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/jI6Bb5"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And if you don’t make it in time you can sign up like a mere mortal for the beta &lt;a href="http://launch.whoworks.at/wyicz"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t worry, they’re pretty fast to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to dress for an interview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviews are a crucial time to make a lasting first impression. You absolutely must give off the impression that you’re a serious,dependable person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear either a suit or a pair of chinos paired with a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/blazers-and-sports-jackets/trendy-blazers-for-men"&gt;blazer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The dress shirt is a must. The only accessories you can wear during an interview (to give off that professional vibe are watches and ties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually wrote an entire article about dressing to get the job, which you can access &lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/formal-wear/how-to-dress-for-an-interview-and-get-the-job-too"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of caution about dressing for an interview: &lt;strong&gt;don’t overdo it&lt;/strong&gt;. You need to impress your potential employee through your knowledge first and foremost. You don’t want to take the focus off that by wearing colors that are too bright or the wrong accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessories (except the watch) almost always steer you away from *expert-land*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dress to impress at a wedding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one rule people say you shouldn’t break when you’re going to a wedding (not your own): to avoid looking better than the groom. My thoughts on the matter: BS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a good style student of mine and know how to put together an outstanding formal outfit, then I don’t see why you should limit yourself. The groom will be fine even if you’re dressed better than him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since a wedding is a very formal event, the suit is the only way to go. Sure, there are people who wear khakis and a sports &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/coats-and-jackets/which-mens-jacket-is-more-attractive"&gt;jacket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/blazers-and-sports-jackets/trendy-blazers-for-men"&gt;blazer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but wearing a suit shows you’re aware of the importance of the event and that you respect the bride and the groom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry: even in a suit you still have lots of ways to stand out. Choose a less common color (such as brown or blue), choose a brown pair of &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (because brown is, again, less worn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to stand out through your shirt, go for a striped or a checked one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget the &lt;em&gt;piesse de resistance&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/five-reason-to-wear-ties"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Ideally you want to go for a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/five-reason-to-wear-ties"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that REPEATS one of the colors on the shirt. The &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/five-reason-to-wear-ties"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should also make a lot of contrast with the shirt – a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/five-reason-to-wear-ties"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which you can barely distinguish is better kept at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re serious about dressing to impress at a wedding, be sure to check out some pocket squares. Most guys never wear them and they are absolutely fantastic. Again, make sure you make some sort of contrast with the suit &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/coats-and-jackets/which-mens-jacket-is-more-attractive"&gt;jacket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One rule about pocket squares, though: if you’re wearing a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shirts/the-white-shirt-a-classic"&gt;white shirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the pocket square HAS to be white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to wear in a club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clubs are a great way to go a little over the edge with your style. Everyone there is having fun and so should you. The thing about clubs is that most guys already dress well so you’re *forced* to be one notch above them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessories are a great way to do that and you have lots of options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an in-depth analysis of what to wear in clubs to stand out, check out this &lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/casual-wear/how-to-project-sexual-confidence-in-clubs-and-bars"&gt;extensive guide&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dress to impress at work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your work environment can quickly become dull, especially since people tend to be very focused on work and less focused on socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/formal-wear/the-smart-casual-dress-code-for-men"&gt;business casual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/formal-wear/the-smart-casual-dress-code-for-men"&gt;smart casual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, as the two terms are used interchangeably) is to be unique but not to overdo it. Like I said, people are focused on their work and you shouldn’t distract them with any bold colored or over-accessorized outfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think khakis, ties, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/sweaters/cardigans-for-men-the-style-secret-celebrities-dont-want-you-to-know"&gt;cardigans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, dress shirts and leather &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Here’s an article where I discuss &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/formal-wear/the-smart-casual-dress-code-for-men"&gt;smart casual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in-depth: &lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/formal-wear/the-smart-casual-dress-code-for-men"&gt;The smart casual dress code for men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to wear on a first date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh.. the first date. Some guys have no clue how important it is to be dressed properly at a first date. If you got that far, it’s obvious the girl is interested in you and she’s trying to gather as much data as she can about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, what you’re wearing will tell her a lot about you. You know women, they interpret everything. So why not give her some good reasons to want to go on a second date with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you can play this. I don’t know which one is right for you or for the girl you’re dating so you have to do your homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re only trying to have sex with the girl and she’s a party girl or dresses extravagantly, then you should probably do the same. Wear cocky colors, be cocky and let the chips fall where they may.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you’re dating a girl who is relationship material, you want to earn her trust. Even if you’re only going for sex but she’s shy, you shouldn’t wear too bold colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go for warm, earthy colors, such as purple, blue and brown to make her feel comfortable. Stay away from combinations such as all white, black and yellow or pink (keep them for when you’re out partying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to wear during weekdays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re just going to to do your shopping, you shouldn’t disregard the way you look. If you respect yourself then you should dress stylishly every time you go out. The reason is that, first and foremost, you’re doing it for yourself, to feel good in your own skin, not for  others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of clothing items you can choose for day-to-day wear. Sneakers, loafers, jeans, t-shirt/vest combinations, t-shirt/&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/how-should-men-wear-scarves"&gt;scarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; combinations, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shirts/wear-polo-shirts-for-a-stylish-summer-look"&gt;polo shirts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, rugby shirts etc. etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combinations are unlimited and all you have to do is learn to mix and match them. Check out the Be Stylish ™ package – you’ll find everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The proper attire for a formal dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, a formal dinner requires a suit. Don’t worry, there are still plenty of ways to stand out. A suit isn’t necessarily boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit colors is up to you.I assume you already purchased this so I’m going to tell you the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take care of the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; first. There is one rule you should stick to when it comes to &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and this is in formal situations only: the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should be darker than the suit. Notice how I didn’t say they need to be of the same color… all I said was *darker*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let me give you some specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/suits-2/shirt-and-tie-combinations-for-a-navy-suit"&gt;navy suit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, go for black &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or dark brown &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The brown of the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should be darker than the navy blue of the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wearing a brown suit, make sure the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are of a brown darker than the suit. No black &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in this case, they won’t match well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step: the shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shirt should make a contrast with your suit. If possible, it should contrast with your skin tone as well. If you’re wearing a brown suit,for instance, go for a baby blue shirt. Don’t overdo it, though. A formal dinner implies that you’ll be discussing serious matters and you want to &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, your suit, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shoes/what-stylish-shoes-to-get"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/five-reason-to-wear-ties"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are “boring”(e.g. black suit and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/shirts/the-white-shirt-a-classic"&gt;white shirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), go ahead and play around with the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/five-reason-to-wear-ties"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,the bow &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/accessories/five-reason-to-wear-ties"&gt;tie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the pocket square. In such cases it’s perfectly OK to wear some bold colors such as pink, red or light &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bestylish.org/blog/index.php/matching-your-outfit/in-the-spotlight-the-color-green"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it but it’s not over. If you have any other social situations that I have missed, let me know and I’ll update the article.
