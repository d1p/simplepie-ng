<p align=justify>It&#8217;s no secret that I, among others, have a serious love affair with Jeffrey Campbell shoes.  As a girl who stands at just five feet, platforms and heels at least four inches are a must for me.  I was a bit disappointed to find that <a href="http://solestruck.com">Solestruck</a> didn&#8217;t have my size in stock in almost anything that I wanted to order, but hopefully they&#8217;ll restock and I&#8217;ll get an opportunity to snatch up my favorites.

I&#8217;m a huge fan of the boho, free-flowing fashions of Free People.  I desperately want to fill my entire closet with their collection for the upcoming Spring/Summer season.  While browsing online, I felt so inspired.  The styling is pure perfection, from the chosen pieces to the accessories, right down to the perfectly tousled hair.  I love, love, love it.  Here&#8217;s a few of my favorite looks.</p>

<h3>1. WHEN IT COMES TO ME PERSONALLY &#8211; I OWE A LOT OF WHO I AM TO: </h3>
<p align=justify>
My family, especially my parents.  My mom is, without a doubt, my best friend in the world and the most beautiful woman I know, inside and out.  My dad is the hardest working person I’ve ever met and has always remained selfless, putting his loved ones first, always.  My son has changed me and helped me grow, over these past five years.  It’s amazing what you can learn about life and yourself through the eyes of a child.  My friends, especially my girls, have stuck with me through thick and thing.  I’m blessed to have a small group of close-knit friends who I’ve known for 15+ years and are still by my side.  There are so many amazing people whom I’ve met along the way and have helped to shape the person that I am.  </p>
<h3>2. WHEN IT COMES TO ME PROFESSIONALLY &#8211; I OWE A LOT OF WHO I AM TO: </h3>
<p align=justify>
My best friend, Laura, has always pushed me to succeed, regardless of which venture I was attempting to conquer on that particular day.  Although I consider myself a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to my profession, everything that I do is somehow art/design related.  My high school art teacher had a lot to do with my drive and passion for the arts.  As a make-up artist, Debra Macki was a huge inspiration for me, in addition to being a wonderful teacher.  However, this list wouldn’t be complete without adding my friend Genny, who has always been my partner in crime, dreaming up these elaborate project ideas and keeping the idea that “we can be anything we want to be when we grow up” dream alive, well into our 20’s.</p>
<h3>3. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ART OF BLOGGING, I&#8217;M GRATEFUL TO THESE PEOPLE FOR HELPING ME THROUGH SOME OF THE ROUGH SPOTS: </h3>
<p align=justify>
I’ve been blogging for so long, since before the word “blog” was even coined.  Although I took a brief hiatus, there were so many people who helped and inspired me along the way.  There is a group of old school bloggers who are still blogging today, including <a href="http://misscindybabyyy.com" target=_blank>Cindy</a>, <a href="http://cupcakerehab.com/" target=_blank>Marilla</a> &#038; <a href="http://mostbeautifullest.com" target=_blank>Huny</a>, who are all amazing and inspirational after all these years.  Although I couldn&#8217;t possibly mention all of your names, the bloggers who built the community which I was a part of so many years ago are the people who taught me and inspired me to become a better blogger and designer.  Thanks to Jenny, Anna, Rain, David, Joanna, Dominique, Jai, Chelsea, Erica, Carlos, Star.  </p>
<h3>4. ONE BLOGGING CHALLENGE I&#8217;M GRATEFUL HAPPENED BECAUSE IT MADE ME STRONGER WAS&#8230;</h3>
<p align=justify>
Reading my old posts from 10+ years ago was an incredible learning experience.  I used to write another blog, as some of you may know, which was more like a personal, tell-all diary than a blog.  I wrote openly about everything in my life, from love to friendships and everything in between.  Although I look back and sometimes regret putting my entire life online for the world to read, however being able to look back on it and learn from it feels invaluable to me.  I don’t think that I would have kept a journal otherwise, but for a period of about five years, I have a day-to-day account of my life, told in my own words.  It’s interesting to be able to look back at the things you did and to remember how you felt at that very moment.  Do I regret writing so candidly?  Sometimes.  But I love having something to look back on, as opposed to having nothing at all.  </p>
<h3>5. TO MY READERS, I&#8217;D LIKE TO SAY&#8230;</h3>
<p align=justify>
Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Although I blog because I love to write, I also blog because I love the community aspect.  I’ve made so many wonderful friends through my sites throughout the years.  I’d also like to send an extra special thank you to those of you who’ve searched for me based on my old blogs.  It’s amazing to hear from readers who’ve been following me and reading my blogs for so long.  Words can’t express how much I appreciate your support.  </p>

<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p align=justify>This week, for <em>TILT</em>, I&#8217;ve decided to share my favorite beauty products available at <a href="http://sephora.com">Sephora</a>.  I use most of these items on a daily basis and would recommend them to anyone.  Without further ado, on to the list. </p>
<p><h3>1. HOOLA BY BENEFIT COSMETICS:</h3>
<p> My all time favorite bronzer!  This shade is perfect on most skin tones and creates a perfect sun kissed glow.  Benefit has such cute packaging too, which is a bonus.</p>
<h3>2. SMITH&#8217;S ROSEBUD SALVE:</h3>
<p> A must have in any girl&#8217;s purse.  With a price tag under $5, this little gem is the smoothest lip conditioner that I own.  Rosebud Salve is sweet smelling and adds just a hint of color to your lips.  Sheer perfection, literally.</p>
<h3>3. MURAD CLARIFYING CLEANSER:</h3>
<p> I never go anywhere without this facial cleanser.  I&#8217;ve been using Murad products for years.  Every time I decide to try something else, I always end up coming back.  This is a staple in my skincare routine.  </p>
<h3>4. HELLO KITTY LIQUID NAIL ART:</h3>
<p> Pastel nails are everywhere you look this spring.  The Hello Kitty Collection offers a selection of soft, powdery hues.  The adorable Hello Kitty shaped bottle makes it hard to say no to this entire collection. </p>
<h3>5. BENEFIT BAD GAL LASH MASCARA:</h3>
<p> The best mascara, ever!  Period.  I usually have to use two or three different products to achieve the look of this one mascara.  </p>
<h3>6. MISS DIOR CHERIE:</h3>
<p> My favorite perfume, which I&#8217;m all out of at the moment.  Note to self, buy a new bottle.</p>
<h3>7. JUICY BEAUTY GREEN APPLE PEEL:</h3>
<p> I tried this face mask based on reviews on Sephora last year.  After one use, my skin felt and looked noticeably softer and smoother.  It stings a bit, but goes away in minutes and is well worth it.  This is a Sephora online exclusive and is also available in a sensitive skin formula.  </p>
<h3>8. BUMBLE &#038; BUMBLE SURF SPRAY:</h3>
<p> I&#8217;m addicted to saltwater sprays for your hair that give you that &#8220;spent the day at the beach&#8221; look.  Surf Spray gives your hair a tousled, undone look and works great as a refresher for wavy or curly hair.  John Frieda also makes an excellent saltwater spray, but Bumble &#038; Bumble&#8217;s is my fave.</p>
<h3>9. OJON DRY SHAMPOO SPRAY:</h3>
<p> My mom always told me not to wash my hair every day, to keep it soft and silky.  On days when I don&#8217;t feel like restyling or am pressed for time, this dry shampoo works wonders.  I&#8217;ve tried a few dry shampoos, but I love the soft, powdery smell of this one.  I keep a nifty travel sized bottle in my car, which often comes in handy.</p>
<h3>10. MAKEUP FOREVER HD FOUNDATION:</h3>
<p> For normal days, I usually use a lighter foundation but when I&#8217;m looking for extra coverage, HD Foundation is my go-to product.  Silky smooth and evens out my skin flawlessly.  </p>
<h3>11. URBAN DECAY EYESHADOW PRIMER POTION:</h3>
<p> The day that I discovered eyeshadow primer changed my life.  This was one of those products that I didn&#8217;t think I needed until I used it.  Primer potion keeps your shadow in place all day and prevents creasing. My make-up bag is not complete without it.  </p>

<small>Source: <a href="http://weheartit.com" target="_blank">WeHeartIt</a></small></center></p>
<p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p align=justify>
All right, so if you’re a regular visitor to this site, you’ve probably been wondering if I was still alive.  Fear not, my lovely readers!  I am still here and I promise to never leave you again (without notice).  Over the last couple of weeks, I broke a promise to myself to keep up with my blog, at all costs.  I vowed to post five times a week, at minimum, once this site launched.  It goes without saying that I didn’t completely follow through.  Much of the reason why I haven’t been actively writing these last couple of weeks is because my life has been a roller coaster of twists and turns.  While I won’t bore you with the details of my life, I can’t honestly say that my being busy has been the ultimate cause of my absence.  It started out that way, but it turned into a big, fat case of writer’s block aka Blogger Blues.  </p>
<p align=justify>
I’m sure I’m not alone, every blogger feels unmotivated and uninspired from time to time.  Whether we get bored with our blog, can’t think of anything creative to write about or lack the motivation to post, writer’s block is a curse that each of us will face at one time or another.  However, I’m happy to say that I’m now feeling refreshed and inspired.  I thought it only fair that I share with you how I got my groove back and kicked my “Blogger Blues”.</p>
<p align=justify>
<h3>1.	STEP AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER: </h3>
<p>I know it&#8217;s hard, but taking a break can make all the difference.  Our lives are busy with work, school, kids AND our blogs.  A lot of us find ourselves using our spare time to work on our blogs and, therefore, neglecting our social lives.  Take a break from blogging and spend a well deserved night out with your girlfriends or a relaxing afternoon with your family.  Spend the day at the spa or just spend the day chillaxin!  Your blog will thank you the next morning.    </p>
<h3>2.	FIND SOME INSPIRATION:</h3>
<p>Inspiration is everywhere.  Skip the obvious and look for inspiration in other mediums such as art, music, television.  Style bloggers can work up some motivation via some retail therapy.  It works every time ladies! </p>
<h3>3.	GET INVOLVED: </h3>
<p>Step away from your own blog and do some exploring.  Click away, find new sites to inspire you.  Become an active participant within blogging communities such as IFB and FBFF.  Getting to know fellow bloggers will not only make the experience feel more authentic, but getting to know your readers will help you to find inspiration when writing for them.  </p>
<h3>4.	GIVE YOUR BLOG A FACELIFT: </h3>
<p>If you’re sick of looking at the same old thing every day, spice things up a bit.  If you’ve got some design experience, create a new theme for your blog, design a new header image or simply change the colors a bit.  If not, do some minor updating or do a Google search for pre-made themes to give your blog a new look.  A fresh look may just inspire some new ideas.</p>
<h3>5.	TAKE NOTES: </h3>
<p>Keep a notebook on your person at all times.  Moleskine makes the perfect little hardcover notebook, which fits nicely into any little clutch and lasts forever.  You’d be surprised how often post ideas cross your mind throughout the day.  Making note of them the moment they pop up will supply you with a never-ending list of topics that will come in handy when writer’s block kicks in.  </p>
<h3>6.	WRITE YOUR MANIFESTO: </h3>
<p>Remind yourself why you started blogging in the first place.  Sit down and write a few paragraphs to explain what you stand for and what your blog is all about.  Putting into writing why you’re so passionate about your blog will definitely put things into perspective and give you a huge boost in motivation.   </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://modlychic.blogspot.com">FBFF</a> question asks us to list five things that we&#8217;ve learned in our time blogging. LiveForFashion is relatively new, however I&#8217;ve had a presence on the web for nearly ten years. Things in the blogosphere have changed dramatically since I started, way back in 2000, but I&#8217;ve definitely learned a thing or two in those ten years.<br />
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p><center><br />
<a href="http://liveforfashion.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/just_lessons_learned_by_aniz_c-d2xs2fb_large.jpg"><img src="http://liveforfashion.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/just_lessons_learned_by_aniz_c-d2xs2fb_large.jpg" alt="" title="FBFF: Lessons in Blogging" width="500" height="384" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-486" /></a><br />
</center></p>
<p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p align=justify>
<h3>1. BE YOURSELF &#038; NO ONE ELSE.</h3>
<p> With so many blogs on the web, it can be difficult to set yourself apart from the herd. Celebrate what makes you unique and highlight those qualities in your blog. Be inspired by others whom you admire, but create your own style of blogging, original content and custom design. </p>
<h3>2. NETWORK &#038; USE THE TOOLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL.</h3>
<p> Social networking has quickly become a huge part of our everyday social lives, but can also be an excellent tool for your blog. Blogging, although a personal venture, would not exist or be as interesting if not for our peers and their support. Use twitter, facebook and other communities to interact with fellow bloggers. The relationships that you form will not only help to grow your blog but can spawn friendships with people that you may not have met otherwise.</p>
<h3>3. DON&#8217;T COUNT CALORIES.</h3>
<p>  Every blogger wants their posts to be read by hundreds, if not thousands of readers but checking your stats ten times a day won&#8217;t help to grow your readership.  This blog is just a baby, only five months old, but six years ago I shut down a popular blog that boasted hundreds of unique viewers a day.  I started blogging with only a few readers, personal friends and online contacts that I knew.  I took numerous steps towards bringing traffic to my website, but my numbers remained the same.  It was only when I stopped trying so hard and concentrated on my content that my blog exploded.  I&#8217;m not saying not to work towards gaining more hits, but content is ultimately what sells.  Time, patience and a little love goes a long way.  </p>
<h3>4. DON&#8217;T BE A QUITTER.</h3>
<p>  Blogging is hard work and sometimes we lose our motivation.  It happens to everyone.  When times get tough and you feel like you just don&#8217;t want to do it anymore, don&#8217;t quit.  Take a break.  Take a vacation from your laptop and give yourself time to breathe.  Most likely, you&#8217;ll come back refreshed and wondering why you ever considered giving up on your blog.  My biggest regret, in terms of blogging, is shutting down my old site when I grew tired of it.  Who knows where I&#8217;d be as a blogger or a web/graphic designer had I kept moving forward. </p>
<h3>5. KEEP IT CLEAN.</h3>
<p>  If you wouldn&#8217;t want your dad to see it, don&#8217;t write it on your blog!  Some bloggers openly discuss their blog in their social circle and others keep it a secret.  Either way, the web is searchable.  Anyone can find everything, even if you delete your blog altogether.  Before you click that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button, be sure that you haven&#8217;t written anything that you would be embarrassed about your family, co-workers or your boss reading.  </p>

<p align=justify>
So, if you&#8217;re wondering where you are and how you got here, have no fear!  You&#8217;re in the right place.  I made the decision to change the name and URL of my blog for a number of reasons.  I&#8217;ve made a new home here at LiveForFashion and am back from my brief hiatus.  I didn&#8217;t intend to take such a long break from blogging, but once I started designing the new site, I didn&#8217;t have much time left to blog.  School, motherhood, the redesign and other issues took up 110% of my time.  Now that this site is live, I can focus on updating the layout over the next few weeks.  I have a completely different custom WordPress theme in the works, but I made the stupid mistake of overwriting the stylesheet at Urban-kitten without a backup and ultimately ended up making a split decision to redirect to the new URL, rather than take the time to re-code my old layout.  So, stay tuned for a new look around here in the next month or so.<br />
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p align=justify><a href="http://liveforfashion.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gff_lff2.jpg"><img src="http://liveforfashion.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gff_lff2.jpg" alt="" title="LiveforFashion.com" width="550" height="825" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-478" /></a><br />
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p align=justify>
On another note, I&#8217;m in the market for an entry-level D-SLR.  My ancient digital camera is just about ready to die and I&#8217;m definitely ready to upgrade from your average point-and-shoot.  After a ton of research and reading reviews, I&#8217;ve narrowed it down to three choices: Nikon D3100, Olympus PEN P-1 or Pentax K-X (white).  I&#8217;m pretty clueless when it comes to SLR&#8217;s, so if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.  I&#8217;d love to hear what you all think before I drop such a hefty chunk of change on a new camera.  </p>

<p>Color has always been a huge inspiration in all aspects of my life, including design, fashion and home decor.  However, color doesn&#8217;t seem to find it&#8217;s way into my wardrobe as often as it should.  This week, <a href="http://www.modlychic.com/friend-friday-fbff">FBFF</a> explores the use of color in our wardrobe.  The questions were inspired by <a href="http://welovecolors.com/">WeLoveColors</a>, who graciously sponsored this week&#8217;s set of FBFF questions.  As always, be sure to visit our hostess Katy at <a href="http://www.modlychic.com/">ModlyChic</a> and check out everyone&#8217;s perspective.</p>

<h3>1. What color dominates your closet?</h3>
<p>After going through my closet and choosing items for 30&#215;30, it became pretty apparent that the majority of my wardrobe falls into three color categories: black, white and grey. As a teenager, I incorporated a lot of color into my wardrobe but as I&#8217;ve grown I&#8217;ve ended up with a basically monochromatic closet. I&#8217;ve come to realize that even my son&#8217;s clothes are black, white, grey and neutral hues.  Maybe it&#8217;s time to spice things up a bit!</p>
<h3>2. If money weren&#8217;t an issue how would you change the color emphasis in your closet?</h3>
<p>If money weren&#8217;t an issue, I would buy <em>everything</em>. Color is such a huge source of inspiration for me in all aspects of my life, but like many other women, I&#8217;ve got to carefully pick and choose what I spend my money on. I tend to stick to basics and try to approximate the cost per wear when shopping, so I lean towards items that are easily mixed with my current wardrobe and are highly wearable.</p>
<h3>3. What is your mantra about mixing colors?</h3>
<p>I love experimenting with color schemes. However you&#8217;re more likely to see color mixing in my design projects rather than my closet. I think that a mixture of unexpected hues brings interest to any visual element.</p>
<h3>4. For you, how do you incorporate color into your outfits?</h3>
<p>As I said, the majority of my wardrobe is shades or black and white but I do mix hints of color into my outfits with accessories and layering. Scarfs, shoes, cardigans and belts are my typical M.O. when adding color to my looks. As a make-up artist, I tend to incorporate color into my make-up when there is no color on my body. I am a former MAC artist, so I became accustomed to wearing all black and adding a pop of color on my eyes or lips. I&#8217;d really like to add some bright hues to my Spring and Summer wardrobe this year. My boyfriend always notices when I wear color because it happens so rarely.</p>
<h3>5. Which blogger(s) do you think do a good job of incorporating color into their wardrobe?</h3>
<p>I love how <a href="http://galadarling.com">Gala</a> brings color into both her wardrobe and her website. <a href="http://www.keikolynn.com/">Keiko Lynn</a> is also a favorite colorful blogger. I adore the muted hues that she mixes into her wardrobe, as well as the various make-up looks that she wears to bring color to her look.</p>

After posting a photo of my black on black, matte french manicure, I got a few e-mail requests asking how I did it.  I decided to do a short tutorial.  It&#8217;s an easy process, but there were a few things that I had to learn the hard way.  Firstly, be sure to apply a top coat on top of the black.  The matte polish seems to strip away the polish underneath and I found that adding a top coat helps to eliminate streaking.  Secondly, be gentle with the matte polish and allow it to dry completely before peeling the strips.  Enjoy!</p>
