Kristin Gundred, a/k/a Dee Dee, is no actual dum dum, so she made good where Vivian Girls didn&#8217;t. One sonically buried experience (2010&#8242;s I Will Be) was enough to make her realize that with a big girl-group concept should come big songs, so she&#8217;d better write some. With help from the Raveonettes&#8217; Sune Rose Wagner and &#8220;My Boyfriend&#8217;s Back&#8221; co-writer Richard Gottehrer, 2011 EP He Gets Me High wiped out that lo-fi crap with a husky new voice (not Gundred&#8217;s first metamorphosis — just dig up her Gossip-style work with Grand Ole Party) on two high-powered hooksongs, one sweet-enough ballad, and a Smiths cover that rocked. Six months later, she delivers an album that sounds like Chrissie Hynde backed by Hüsker Dü. Only in Dreams could make you wonder what other indie bands would jump up and thrive if only they had steamroller production. But the boiling guitar tones bind the songwriting tighter than Gundred&#8217;s leather jacket, even on the six-minute &#8220;Coming Down.&#8221; The Buddy Holly–esque &#8220;Heartbeat&#8221; helps balance the &#8217;80s-isms, and every time she kisses something called &#8220;Bedroom Eyes&#8221; too wistfully there&#8217;s something around the corner like &#8220;Just a Creep&#8221; to bite down hard.</p>

After 12 years, four albums, and a revolving door of close to 20 musicians, Canadian indie rock collective Broken Social Scene might be calling it quits for good. The alternative supergroup has decided to go on &#8220;indefinite hiatus,&#8221; according to our colleagues at the Huffington Post.</p>
<p>Speaking to Huffington Post backstage at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, lead singer Kevin Drew explained, &#8220;There&#8217;s no bad blood, no problems, everyone is at peace. We&#8217;ve had a lot of inter-relationships, some have worked, some haven&#8217;t. But we all loved what we were doing. And I think we were always fair.&#8221; The festival was to be one of the band&#8217;s last North American shows before embarking on indefinite hiatus, that purgatorial term which has doomed many a rock group.</p>
<p>As one might imagine, trying to schedule band practice with close to 20 musicians is not an easy task. &#8220;It&#8217;s like wrangling cats,&#8221; Drew says. Not dogs. &#8220;Dogs would actually listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Due to the fungible nature of the project, and their several attempts to disband, a full and complete ending to BSS seems hard to believe. Their most recent album, &#8216;Forgiveness Rock Record&#8217; was completed after an &#8220;extended hiatus&#8221; during which many of the group&#8217;s multiple members embarked upon projects like Stars, Metric, Do Make Say Think, Land of Talk and many others. Drew and Brendan Canning, another founding member, have both released solo albums of their own. Most visible of these acts might be Leslie Feist, whose breakout single &#8220;1234&#8243; launched her to international fame, and sold a whole bunch of iPods.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to dilute what we&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Drew said. &#8220;But I&#8217;d like to find other ways of telling the story of our band.&#8221; Here&#8217;s to hoping he does just that, or just makes another Broken Social Scene album.</p>

As you might expect, Eddie Vedder and company do the song justice, from its varied instrumentation and time signatures to the gripping vocals. The performance leaves us wondering when another seminal, forward-thinking outfit&#8217;s expansive catalog will be celebrated on late-night TV. Also, which band will it be? Zeppelin? Zappa? Beatles?

The Occupy Wall Street protesters camped out in Lower Manhattan&#8217;s Zuccotti Park are buzzing over a big secret musical guest scheduled to play this afternoon at around 4pm. We hear that it&#8217;s Radiohead, who are in New York for a couple concerts.</p>
<p>It makes sense: Radiohead&#8217;s lead singer Thom Yorke has a history of lefty anti-globalization protest. What do you think: Are the millionaires from Radiohead authentic enough to be the bards of revolution? They&#8217;re certainly capable of mobilizing people: When their New York show sold out in minutes they almost caused <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/09/all-your-radiohead-tickets-are-belong-to-machines11">a Twitter riot.</a></p>
<p>Update: It&#8217;s been confirmed by Occupywallstreet.org the official website of Occupy Wall Street. An Occupy Wall Street spokesman told me, they have no permit but the police are &#8220;aware&#8221; of the event.</p>

Watch the video below.</p>
<p>MGMT played a song that would seem natural for the East Coast psych-rockers: &#8220;Lucifer Sam,&#8221; from 1967&#8242;s playful, acid-warped The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Joining the band with a reel-to-reel tape player was Cox, wearing what looked like the same Joey Ramone costume he donned during a recent Georgia show with the Black Lips. Ample amounts of bubbles and dry-ice fog accompanied the ensemble&#8217;s faithfully trippy performance</p>
<p>Fallon&#8217;s week-long tribute to Floyd continues Thursday, when country star Dierks Bentley will perform the title track from Wish You Were Here. Pearl Jam will cap the week Friday with The Walls &#8220;Mother.&#8221; The performances coincide with an enormous Pink Floyd reissues series, kicked off this week with a six-disc box set edition of The Dark Side of the Moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luficer Sam&#8221; isn&#8217;t the only psych-tinged song MGMT have covered recently. The band&#8217;s spaced-out version of Bauhaus&#8217;s &#8220;All We Ever Wanted Was Everything&#8221; will appear on MGMT&#8217;s entry in the U.K. LateNightTales compilation series.</p>
<p>Cox&#8217;s Atlas Sound project releases its third proper album, Parallax, on November 8. Hear &#8220;Terra Incognita&#8221; here.</p>

Band Of Horses start work on their fourth album Band also admit to being &#8216;really frustrated&#8217; after support slot with Kings Of Leon was axed last month</p>
<p>Guitarist Tyler Ramsay says the band have been busy working on the follow-up to their 2010 LP &#8216;Infinite Arms&#8217; despite the fact he&#8217;s been recording debut solo album &#8216;Valley Wind&#8217;.</p>
<p>He told Apesontape.com: It&#8217;s full on for the next record. We&#8217;re really trying to get it solidified and get it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The band also admitted that they were &#8220;really frustrated&#8221; after their ill-fated tour with Kings Of Leon was recently cancelled. The Followills pulled the remaining dates of their North American tour last month, citing frontman Caleb Followill&#8217;s &#8220;vocal issues and exhaustion&#8221; as the reason for shelving the dates. </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Exhaustion&#8217;, yeah, I think it was the third show into what was supposed to be a seven-week tour,&#8221; Ramsay said. &#8220;It was really, really frustrating and quite maddening. </p>
<p>&#8220;We were in Tampa, Florida and we just sat there for three days wondering what was going to happen. Every 30 minutes there would be some weird update about booking shows here or there. We ended up going to El Paso and recording, doing some demo stuff in a studio there.&#8221; </p>

Pink Floyd week continued Tuesday night on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, as Foo Fighters performed with the U.K. rock icons&#8217; own Roger Waters. Watch the video below (via The Audio Perv).</p>
<p>Dave Grohl and Co. faithfully covered &#8220;In the Flesh?,&#8221; the opening track from 1979 rock opera The Wall, with Waters singing lead and playing bass. Foo Fighters and Waters &#8212; or &#8220;Roger and the Foos,&#8221; as host Jimmy Fallon called them &#8212; alternated with brawny, accomplished ease between the song&#8217;s trudging acid-rock riffs and its airy, soul-tinged verse.</p>
<p>Fallon also sat down with Waters for an interview. When not showing off his impression of staunchly traditionalist 1950s pop singer Pat Boone, the Pink Floyd founding member had some very complimentary words for the Shins, who covered The Dark Side of the Moon&#8217;s &#8220;Breathe&#8221; Monday night. &#8220;What a great singer that kid is,&#8221; Waters said of frontman James Mercer.</p>
<p>Fallon&#8217;s week-long tribute to Floyd continues Wednesday, when MGMT will cover &#8220;Lucifer Sam,&#8221; off The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Country star Dierks Bentley will perform the title track from Wish You Were Here on Thursday, and Pearl Jam will close out the week Friday with The Wall&#8217;s &#8220;Mother.&#8221; Pink Floyd kicked off a massive reissues series this week with a six-disc box set edition of The Dark Side of the Moon.</p>

In his heyday, he lived at 783 Bel Air Road, a four-bedroom, 5,432-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion that once belonged to John Phillips of The Mamas &#038; the Papas. The Tudor-style house was tricked out in his signature funky black, white and red color scheme. Shag carpet. Tiffany lamps in every room. A round water bed in the master bedroom. There were parties where Stevie Wonder, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Miles Davis would drop by, where Etta James would break into &#8220;At Last&#8221; by the bar.</p>
<p>Just four years ago, he resided in a Napa Valley house so large it could only be described as a &#8220;compound,&#8221; with a vineyard out back and multiple cars in the driveway. But those days are gone.</p>
<p>Today, Sly Stone &#8212; one of the greatest figures in soul-music history &#8212; is homeless, his fortune stolen by a lethal combination of excess, substance abuse and financial mismanagement. He lays his head inside a white camper van ironically stamped with the words &#8220;Pleasure Way&#8221; on the side. The van is parked on a residential street in Crenshaw, the rough Los Angeles neighborhood where &#8220;Boyz n the Hood&#8221; was set. A retired couple makes sure he eats once a day, and Stone showers at their house. The couple&#8217;s son serves as his assistant and driver.<br />
Inside the van, the former mastermind of Sly &#038; the Family Stone, now 68, continues to record music with the help of a laptop computer. -[NY Post]</p>

The dictionary definition tells you this: &#8216;With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterised by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.&#8217;</p>
<p>All the above is true of Mastodon, perhaps the best and brightest purveyor of the heavy stuff around, since their grimy and gruesome start as an uncompromising thrash outfit at the start of the last decade. Now major label 200,000-unit-shifting purveyors of the most progressive, aggressive yet surprisingly melodic metal you could hope to hear, the Atlanta, Georgia four-piece are back.</p>
<p>Many fans may have been hoping for another installment in the lineage of 2004’s Leviathan, 2006’s Blood Mountain and Crack the Skye in 2009 &#8211; the greatest concept-driven prog-metal trilogy since&#8230; well, since ever.</p>
<p>Instead, The Hunter is Mastodon with an edge of complexity removed. Songs run to five or six minutes, instead of nine or ten as previously (the average running time here is 3.89 minutes, almost half that of Skye, metal fact fans).</p>
<p>Previously, Mastodon tracks had three or four distinct sections within each song, often with different time signatures, making them “a bitch to play live” according to drummer extraordinaire and, increasingly, vocalist. Brann Dailor. Not so, The Hunter.</p>
<p>Opener ‘Black Tongue’ is a classic none-more-metal riff, invoking Slayer and early Metallica. ‘Blasteroid’, a minnow time-wise at 2.36, lives up to its title with uptempo explosion of positive energy and the memorable refrain: &#8220;I wanna drink some fucking blood! I wanna break some fucking glass!”</p>
<p>‘Stargasm’’s eerie synth lines and cheerful central motif almost recalls Zeppelin, while the bizarre ‘Octopus Has No Friends’ mixes vocoder vocals with melodic duelling guitars and an earth-shattering rhythm. Stupendous.</p>
<p>You may have heard lead single &#8216;Curl of the Burl&#8217; &#8211; the dirtiest, funkiest sound in the Mastodon canon. Its Sabbath-esque riff could level trees and scare police horses. It’s completed by Ozzy-style vocals from fret-twiddler-in-chief Brent Hinds and, do my ears deceive me, handclaps? it’s the most &#8216;pop&#8217; sound yet from a band variously accused of making sludgecore and math-metal (Hinds maintains the band simply makes “classic rock”, for the record).</p>
<p>Whereas previous albums were at least loosely conceptually based around Moby Dick, evil mythological creatures and the life of Rasputin (that last one really does take some explaining), the focus here is broader. Evil beasties and magical powers remain, of course, but this ain’t Tolkeinesque.</p>
<p>The album is dedicated to Brad Hinds, guitarist Brent’s brother (who was an avid hunter) who died during recording. “So we started coming up with all these really triumphant moments for the record. It was like, fist up in the air. Like fuck that – here we go,” Dailor has commented of the intention not to sink into despair.</p>
<p>So Hinds sings with real tenderness on the title track: “All the love I’ve shown / Given to the ones I’ve known / All the love I make / equal to the love I make”. In this genre only Mastodon could make it work and somehow they do, with an intricate, spooky riff and a searing Hinds solo reaching to the sky.</p>
<p>Despite the tragic inspiration, these songs are lighter in mood than anything in the Mastodon songbook. On ‘Creature Lives’, after a Pink Floyd intro of oscillating synths, it’s a justifiably epic, slow-burning, fist-in-the-air stadium rock moment. Album closer &#8216;the Sparrow&#8217; is melancholic and other-worldly, with its ethereal vocals repeating, over and over.</p>
<p>And this from a band that used to write tunes called ‘Mother Puncher’.</p>
<p>The Hunter is a pitch for the mainstream &#8211; but it doesn’t compromise on Mastodon’s core ambition. They are still the most talented, surprising and impressive band making intelligent hard rock today. Now is their time.</p>

Although, it is also because his voice is generally custom built for this particular brand of pensive throwback melancholy. True Moon heads will miss the subsequent three-and-a-half minute instrumental acid freakout “On The Run,” but it’s a little early in the morning for such shenanigans anyway. This is also a nice chance to check out the Shins new lineup in action, so consider that and check it below, along with a listing of the rest of the week’s schedule (MGMT, Pearl Jam, etc.):<br />

Tonight it’s Foo Fighters and the man himself Roger Waters on “In The Flesh,” Wednesday it’s MGMT going in on “Lucifer Sam,” Thursday it’s country dude Dierks Bentley’s turn with “Wish You Were Here,” and the coup de grâce on this whole thing is Pearl Jam’s week-closing take on “Mother.” We will post exactly three of those four. :)</p>

R.E.M., one of the great American rock bands of the last 30 years, announced it is breaking up.</p>
<p>A statement on the band’s Web site reads: “To our Fans and Friends: As R.E.M., and as lifelong friends and co-conspirators, we have decided to call it a day as a band. We walk away with a great sense of gratitude, of finality, and of astonishment at all we have accomplished. To anyone who ever felt touched by our music, our deepest thanks for listening.”</p>
<p>The Athens, Ga.-bred band — vocalist Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills and, until 1997 drummer Bill Berry — became underground and college radio favorites in the 1980s on the strength of classic albums such as “Murmur,” “Reckoning” and “Document.” The ’90s saw them transition to chart-topping superstars thanks to hits such as “Losing My Religion” and “Everybody Hurts.” Even as their popularity declined, the band regularly released new material over the past decade, including its 15th album, “Collapse Into Now,” earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 2:29 p.m. EST Stipe comments on the breakup:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A wise man once said&#8211;&#8217;the skill in attending a party is knowing when it&#8217;s time to leave.&#8217; We built something extraordinary together. We did this thing. And now we&#8217;re going to walk away from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope our fans realize this wasn&#8217;t an easy decision; but all things must end, and we wanted to do it right, to do it our way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to thank all the people who helped us be R.E.M. for these 31 years; our deepest gratitude to those who allowed us to do this. It&#8217;s been amazing.&#8221;<br />
