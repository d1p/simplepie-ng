When I did, I switched to AT&amp;T because, at the time, AT&amp;T was the only carrier for the iPhone. Their service for me was fine, but a bit expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About two months ago, my iPhone crapped out on me and I got an HTC Inspire 4G on AT&amp;T. This was the phone that changed my mind about Android. The Inspire is a pretty sweet phone, no lie. For more thoughts on it, check back a couple posts, I wrote in detail about it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, recently, my ladyfriend’s iPhone 3GS began trying to die on her as well. Combined with the egregious number of deep scratches applied to the screen by two small children, she began considering a new phone. We discussed the options and decided to switch to Sprint from AT&amp;T, given that AT&amp;T revoltingly throttles data on their unlimited plan and that Sprint’s unlimited plans costs roughly $100 a month less than AT&amp;T’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew going in to the Sprint discussion that, if we changed providers, I would be getting the &lt;a title="Samsung Google Nexus S 4G" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/nexus"&gt;Samsung Google Nexus S 4G&lt;/a&gt;. Because it’s badass. It’s also running stock Android, which was a tremendous selling point for me. I’m vehemently opposed to providers that load up phones with heaping piles of crapware (I’m looking at you, Sprint Nascar app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used, read about, tested and generally geeked out over a number of phones during my search, and I’ll boil it down to this: if you are buying an Android phone that is not the Nexus S 4G right now and you have the option to buy the Nexus, you are buying the wrong phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung’s Nexus S is blazing fast. It is the Google equivalent of an iPhone featuring first party design and software implementation. The battery issues that notoriously plague Android based phones are non-existant on the Nexus. I can charge its battery every other day on moderate use and once every day on heavy use. By moderate use I mean making a few phone calls, using Twitter, Facebook and Google+, occasionally surfing the web, sending texts and listening to some music. By heavy use, I mean all of the above plus playing a few games and listening to music virtually all day at work through Audio Technica ATH-M50s, which is a set of full-sized, power-hungry headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of any kind of skin or overlay on the Android framework really speeds things up and seems to account for battery life, at least in part. I like the phone’s form-factor much more than the HTC’s monstrous 4.3” screen as well. Sure, the screen looks great, but unless you have gigantic Herculean hands, it’s too large to operate comfortably one-handed. The curvature of the Nexus’s screen is another excellent, subtle touch that improves ergonomics and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touch sensitivity is something many people complain about when discussing Android phones. The Nexus S 4G uses Samsung’s incredible AMOLED screen and the touch sensitivity is as good or better than an iPhone 4’s. Its responsiveness rivals what you expect from a Star Trek-esque computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, I’ve not found a single problem with the phone. In my book, the Nexus S 4G gets five happy green robots out of five. If you’re in the market for a new smartphone, you’re really selling your smart phone experience short if you don’t strongly consider this excellent, pure-Google contender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve written about an album on here, and that’s a shame. But, my return to writing about music will be a triumphant one. So, let’s just get this show on the road, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Book of Black Earth put out an album called &lt;em&gt;Horoskopus&lt;/em&gt;. By all accounts, it’s a good enough album. I enjoyed it, but it certainly wasn’t enough to turn me into a frothing goober of a fan. It was, however, enough to plant their name in my brain and associate it with good music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on May 17, 2011, when Stereogum’s excellent blog &lt;em&gt;Haunting The Chapel&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a title="Haunting The Chapel" target="_blank" href="http://stereogum.com/706512/stream-book-of-black-earth-the-cold-testament/franchises/haunting-the-chapel/"&gt;offered the album in its entirety free to stream&lt;/a&gt;, I knew it was worth my time to check it out. I listened to the album straight through twice. And, when the album released on the 24th, I knew I’d have to make it my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cold Testament&lt;/em&gt; opens with the absolutely blistering track “Weight Of The World,” which shows the band in top form, having obviously used the years between releases to hone both their technical chops and songwriting skills. The album opener sets the stage for a the rest of the album beautifully, hinting at a landscape of feverish punk ethos on a solid foundation of death metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This album is not deathcore or metalcore, make no mistake. It is a gritty, crunchy death metal LP through and through, but it manages to be one that is catchy in all the best ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standout track “Road Dogs From Hell” is nearly anthemic, but hearkens back to the early 90s Orlando death metal scene. It’s almost a shame that this track isn’t the album’s closer as the album’s outro, “I See Demons” feels weak in comparison, especially following immediately after Dogs. It’s not that “I See Demons” is really a weak track, it’s just that Dogs is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a couple of the tracks feel like they fail to live up to their full potential: the aforementioned “I See Demons” and “Termination” are less than they could have been. It’s unfortunate that this is the case, as the album clocks in at only 36 minutes long. However, the tracks that aren’t great are still good and they won’t leave you feeling let down if you let them play through, even though you will likely skip them on subsequent listenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;The Cold Testament&lt;/em&gt; is a standout album in a year of releases that seems determined to fall short of 2010. Given its short length and a couple squandered minutes of music, I’d award the album 4.5 out of 5 leather jackets. Make no mistake, this is an outstanding album from a band that’s really shaping up to be important in the scene and it is absolutely worth your attention and support.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/5866383514</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/5866383514</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 11:07:00 -0400</pubDate><category>music</category><category>review</category><category>metal</category><category>book of black earth</category><category>the cold testament</category></item><item><title>Android, part 2</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I know you’re all waiting for the followup on that Android post, right? Totally held in thrall by my musings on fundamentally uninteresting tech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s the deal. I’m two weeks in with this thing and I’ve come to a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m keeping it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time using it, reading about Android, spying out apps and becoming very comfortable with both the device itself and the OS that runs it. And, I’ve come to the conclusion that, honestly, neither iOS nor Android is really any better. They’re just different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I first checked out Android, it was a cumbersome, clunky thing, often driven by garbage hardware. Those days are long gone. The touch sensitivity on the phone is excellent, the screen is brilliant, the battery is terrible, and there are infinity percent more apps than I ever want to discover on the Android Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Android &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; has better functionality than the iPhone. There is absolutely no question about that. It’s a more powerful, more customizable and patently more robust experience. Apps truly integrate with one another and many of them have capabilities iOS apps don’t even daydream about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, iOS is truly more intuitive. I am extremely comfortable with technology. I design and build websites, I can code HTML and CSS by hand, I build computers. I can even program a TI-83 graphing calculator &lt;em&gt;like a champ&lt;/em&gt;, but even so, I appreciated a lot of the sleekly implemented UI on iOS. Android has a steeper learning curve, but, honestly, I’d say it also has a greater potential reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android’s architecture is the future. iOS is the phone equivalent of Apple’s OS9 and G-series processors: it’s fundamentally too niche-bound and esoteric ever to become the standard. Apple’s hints about implementing Arduino chips in future builds hint that the folks in Cupertino know it, too. Whether iOS or Android will either ultimately last is anyone’s guess. But, what’s certain is that the architecture of whichever skin ultimately prevails is going to look a lot more like Android’s current guts than iOS’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a big deal, now, but, as they say, if you’ve got to fight a war, it’s best to join the side that’s going to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I think that the iOS style of interface is still definitely the better choice for a lot of people. Technophobes, Mac users and those new to smartphones would probably honestly be better served by an iPhone. It’s not a Mac versus Windows thing here, either. It’s just that the iPhone works &lt;em&gt;so much better&lt;/em&gt; with a Mac than it does with Windows that it’s a whole different experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve found so far is that I appreciate the robust nature of Android’s apps. I appreciate home screen-level widgets and I appreciate that my phone has an actual folder-based hierarchical structure, something the iPhone would be all the better for having. The Android will also &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; sync itself with the cloud, which is a great feature. Cloud-based computing is absolutely the way of the future, and the sooner our peripheral technology is on board, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, I plan to keep my iPhone as a glorified iTouch. There are some apps I just miss that I want to keep using, and it’ll be nice to have it as a backup phone, just in case. It doesn’t work well, but it does still mostly function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, tell me, what do you think? iPhone or Android? What have your experiences been and where do you weigh in?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/5620470255</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/5620470255</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2011 19:39:01 -0400</pubDate><category>android</category><category>iphone</category><category>ios</category><category>apps</category><category>mac</category><category>windows</category><category>technology</category></item><item><title>Android (phone, not robot)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I have, for about 19 months, been an iPhone user. Before the iPhone, I had a Blackberry for a few years. I didn’t really have much of an opinion about the Blackberry, but I suppose it was fine. I could go for two or three days without charging it while using it heavily. That was pretty grand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my Blackberry fell off my printer, which was sitting onto my desk, onto my desk and the screen shattered irreparably. Sprint (boo hiss boo hiss!) was utterly unwilling to work with me or to honor the terms of my insurance so I told them to stuff it and I went and bought an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone, which is a 3G(s) is a sleek and sexy thing that fits nicely in the hand. I do really like the iPhone. It’s got a heap of great apps, it’s incredibly easy to use, very reliable and I’ve never had issues with dropped calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half a year ago, some odd little blemish began on the screen, though, and since then it’s been growing. It’s now about an inch long and it actually makes using the thing kind of difficult. And then maybe three weeks ago, the back plastic casing cracked above the plug. The crack has spread and made plugging the phone into its cable difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cheap upgrade with two-year contract was available and AT&amp;T now has the &lt;a title="HTC Inspire 4G" target="_blank" href="http://www.htc.com/us/products/inspire-att"&gt;HTC Inspire 4G&lt;/a&gt; for $99 and 30 days risk free. So, I decided to give Android a whack, see what I think and take it from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had this phone for a week. Those of you who know me personally will know that I can be award-winningly indecisive about technology. The Inspire 4G is no exception to this rule and I have waffled back and forth on it incessantly, most likely much to the chagrin of the very patient woman who tolerates this sort of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As yet, whether I prefer the iPhone or the Android, I’m just not sure. The Inspire 4G has a mammoth screen that rivals my television for clarity, resolution and brightness. The touch technology HTC uses is excellent and comparable to the iPhone and, honestly, I think the user interface is just about as good on the Android as it is on the iPhone. What the iPhone makes up in sleekness, the Android makes up in functionality. Home screen level widgets (mini-apps that you can run directly on the home screen without actually opening an app) are awesome. The Inspire 4G is also a heaping wad faster than my iPhone 3G(s), but that’s not a fair comparison, because my iPhone is two years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, iPhone apps are better, and there’s no question that it’s prettier. Its battery also dwarfs the HTC’s, and that’s saying something pretty damn depressing about the HTC’s battery. And, I think the form factor of the iPhone suits me a little better. I don’t have gigantic he-man hands, so the iPhone is a nice fit. I also prefer typing on the iPhone in landscape mode to the Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I hate iTunes. Passionately. iTunes is a bad program. If you like it, I’m sorry, you’re just wrong. It’s terrible. Objectively. It’s bloat-ware at its worst (and the notion that I may have to install it on my new computer to update my iPad makes me a bit nauseated). iTunes is all about doing things that Apple wants it to do regardless of whether you want it to do them. It tracks your behavior, markets to you, suggests things to you, integrates movies and everything else under the sun. If you, Steve Jobs, insist that I use some kind of software that you make, please give me the option of one that is JUST a media loader!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do really like the peripherals you can get for the iPhone. It’s been difficult to find a gadget to make my Android play over my car’s FM radio and I haven’t found any slick cases and other gadgets for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, but on the other hand, the Android has an excellent audio out signal. It’s clean, high-powered and even features Dolby Headphone Technology for surround sound if you’re watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’m sure you can see where this review is going. I love the iPhone. I think it’s a really amazing device. If I’d have had this phone first, honestly, I’d probably feel the same way about it. But, I’m like anyone else and I’m resistant to change. I can’t decide whether to keep the Inspire or return it and just suck it up with my busted iPhone until the iPhone 5 is released. But, that does, of course, saddle me with iTunes (grr!), and that’s something I wouldn’t mind avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you have any thoughts, share them! I’ve got another three weeks to live with this gizmo before I make a final decision, so I’m sure I’ll be writing more about it in the coming days. But, until then, I remain faithfully indecisive.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/5261138319</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/5261138319</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2011 22:30:00 -0400</pubDate><category>phone</category><category>apple</category><category>iphone</category><category>technology</category><category>htc</category><category>inspire</category><category>at&amp;amp;t</category></item><item><title>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP</title><description>&lt;p&gt;On the off chance that you don’t know, haven’t guessed or are somehow just living in denial, I want to take a moment to clear the air: I am a humongous, gigantamous and unapologetic nerd. I love video games, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, a good amount of techie ephemera and really shitty sci-fi movies. These things, of course, are in addition to my rabid love of music, art, good food and a whole heaping pile of other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now that THAT’S out of the way…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting at the dining table, my significant other is perched on the couch with a cup of tea and the boy child while the girl child plays on the porch. The significant other is watching a rerun of Bones and I’m happily tapping away at my iPad. She’s just told me, “you should really write about video games and other stuff on your blog, not just music.” Of course I told her that I do write about other things, but, really, her point stands. I should write about more and just write more than I do. But I’ve got a lot going on. So there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a sucker for anything indie. I’ll admit it. I’m listening to Japandroids while I type this… on a little indie app called PlainText (which is awesome, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just played the first level of Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP. And as I am prone to doing, I was just gushing about it. S:S&amp;S is a retro indie adventure “game-type thing” for the iPad that was just released a couple days ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its graphics are evocative of King’s Quest 1-3 but it’s got a decidedly urban, modern flair, especially when dialog is concerned. The music in the game is also quite modern, especially juxtaposed against the retro medieval graphics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I can’t give you a full review of the game because I’m only 17%  through the it. But never fear, I will return to you shortly with a full review of S:S&amp;S EP once I’ve completed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, visit &lt;a href="http://www.swordandsworcery.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.swordandsworcery.com/&lt;/a&gt; to learn more and download the game. Like I said, I can’t really say whether the whole game is any good, but the first level alone is worth $4.99 to play if you ask me. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/4145620108</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/4145620108</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2011 18:51:00 -0400</pubDate><category>iPad</category><category>Video game</category><category>App</category><category>Sword &amp;amp; Sworcery</category><category>Retro</category><category>Indie</category><category>Adventure</category><category>Medieval</category></item><item><title>Iron &amp; Wine: Now With 92% More Interesting</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve kind of always thought of Iron &amp; Wine as the best band that I couldn’t stand for love or money. Every album they’ve made has been excellent, every song expertly crafted and, until now, beyond my abilities as a human being with ears to tolerate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is about Iron &amp; Wine that I loathe so much, I can’t really pinpoint.  I’ve often found them to be the sort of group that just makes me want to fall asleep. It’s not like they’re boring, it’s that they’re just a little too down home sleepy for my taste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’d be lying if I said that I approached “Kiss Each Other Clean” with anything beside the expectation of typical Iron &amp; Wine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But damn, was I ever surprised! Instead of the sleepy folk of previous  albums that had me reaching for an espresso or a pillow, Kiss finds the band toying around with funk inflections, late Disco-era pop construction and edgier lyrical content than on previous albums. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my dislike of previous Iron &amp; Wine albums, I recognize the brilliance of them. This album carries on the tradition of eloquent and rock-solid songwriting established by earlier efforts but finds the band much livelier and more lithe in their playing. The delivery of every song on this album feels energetic and inspired rather than monotonous and labored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether fans will appreciate the direction of this album, I can’t say. But, what I am certain of is that Kiss is a better performance than any other album they’ve made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Album opener “Walking Far From Home” sets the tone for the rest of the album. Its paired lyrical juxtapositions set the stage for an everything under the sun sort of album, and that is exactly what’s delivered. “Me And Lazarus” follows with its shuffling groove and slithering saxophone and tells a sideways story of an odd friendship with a unique dude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters and situations on the album are memorable as always, but the delivery is so spot on that the effect is even greater. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kiss Each Other Clean” is very definitely greater than the sum of its parts and a wonderful reminder never to write off an excellent band merely because you dislike some of their work. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3930574181</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3930574181</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 20:52:56 -0400</pubDate><category>Iron and wine</category><category>Indie</category><category>Rock</category><category>Folk</category><category>Music</category><category>Review</category><category>Good</category><category>2011</category></item><item><title>Technology</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m twenty-eight years old. Certainly not terrifically young, but definitely not old, either. Not by a long shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was a young child, video games were a bit of a novelty. Now, I work for a company that engineers, designs and sells high-end, audiophile-grade headsets specifically for gaming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first computer my family owned was a CompuAd brand 286 desktop computer with what could not have been larger than a nine-inch monitor. It was (quite seriously) a bit of a big deal that this computer was able to change fonts for printing, print black and white graphics and create basic layouts for print. It came with Windows 2.0 installed, had a couple games and a handful of productivity programs. The thing was about as large as a dozen MacBook Pros shoved together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had this computer about twenty or so years ago. It was Top of the line when we bought it, and as I recall it cost close to $1500. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, right now, this minute, I am on Virgin America flight 29 from JFK to SFO and I am typing this blog post on an iPad, a device probably only several percent the size of the first computer my family ever owned that will perform exponentially more complex tasks faster and easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am 35,751 feet above the Earth, traveling at 421 miles an hour. I have 1730 miles to go before I reach SFO. It’s 78 degrees Fahrenheit below 0. I know all this because there is a touch screen computer in the back of the headrest in front of me, and it’s constantly streaming data to me, updating our position via GPS and so on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s incredible how pedestrian all this technology feels. When I stop and actively consider just how incredible it is, it blows my mind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that is exactly what it should do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-1032590103710726029?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900172118</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900172118</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2011 21:32:00 -0500</pubDate><category>flying</category><category>technology</category><category>travel</category></item><item><title>Escapism, fantasy and imagination</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think that we’re all fairly escapist, really. We humans tend to be a “grass is greener” lot. Under almost any other circumstances, I’d hesitate to do this, but I’m going to go out on a limb here and &lt;a href="http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story01.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;quote Varg Vikernes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, famed madman/genius behind Burzum, “The magic was necessary only because I wasn’t satisfied with the&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; world. There was no adventure, no fear or trolls, dragons or undead creatures. No magic. So I figured I had to create the magic myself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our world is predictable. Even the most fantastic things are second-nature to us now. Consider flying. Every day, millions of people are hurled through the sky, close to the speed of sound, miles above the Earth, without incident. If I become ill, I visit the doctor and I’m given some pills to take and I get better. I don’t worry that my flu is caused by evil spirits accosting me for some sin I’ve committed. Instead, I know I’m sick because of a virus or bacteria that got into my system because I probably didn’t wash my hands quite often enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do I wish we lived in a dangerous world, where mania and hysteria ruled? Certainly not. But, a world in which dragons &lt;em&gt;just might&lt;/em&gt; exist and people undertook vast quests? You bet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I love my iPhone, my indoor plumbing and espresso drinks. But, I really think that we as a species have kind of lost our path. I’m not sure where we got off it or what exactly went wrong, but I get the sense from talking to a lot of people that our so-called progress hasn’t really brought us closer to enlightenment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What it has brought is a complacent numbness and malaise. As children, we go through the motions of school. We learn what the state has determined is important. And I’ll grant that oftentimes what we learn is important, but often it is not. Then, we leave our compulsory education behind and venture out into either work or secondary education. And then it’s basically just routine again until we retire or die. I’m well aware that I’m offering a grossly oversimplified rendering of our lives here in America, but at the same time, I think the basics are fairly accurate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We could agree to go live in denial in little enclaves like in the movie &lt;em&gt;The Village&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s just not practical. You can’t really unsee or unlearn or unknow things once you’ve been exposed to them. And that’s the trouble. So, what then, are we to do? Some of us are, I’m sure, quite satisfied with everything. I’m not one of that group and I know that most of my friends aren’t either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back to what I said right at the beginning: I think we’re all escapists on some level. What our particular escape is is often unique, but I think most of us need to fantasize and use our imaginations to make it through the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Personally, I have developed the happy fantasy that medieval life was, in many ways, the pinnacle of human existence. Sure, there was shit in the streets and a plague and a crazy (crazier than now, even) church rampaging about, but I just like to ignore those facts and substitute my own fantasy in their place. One thing I love about medieval existence is how insular it was. When your experience is so small, the world is vast. I’ve never traveled extensively, but in some ways, I can honestly think, “well, China doesn’t seem that foreign to me.” Can you even imagine trying to explain China to an English peasant in the 13th century? It would have literally boggled his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I become mired in day-to-day machinations, I find my mind drifting off temporarily to the fantasy world I wish I could visit. I guess, in some ways, I can visit it. I love&lt;em&gt; Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt;, reading, video games, writing, fantastical music and a number of other imaginative media. After a few minutes of allowing my mind to wander down the alleyways of the towns where bandits lurk in shadows, through the forests where elven rangers track their quarry and across meadows that bring me closer to seeing a castle rising over the horizon, so far in the distance, I’m able to return to my life of concrete, cubicles, commutes, taxes, dress codes, round-the-clock news coverage and pervasive science with a little better perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes it’s difficult. I often find myself actually looking for a way to physically inhabit a world shaped to my own whims. Sometimes, I wonder if it would be possible to build the world I see in my mind with my own two hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What about you? How do you feel about escapism, fantasy and imagination? How do they fit into your daily life?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But dammit, I’m really going to do it. On February 2, 2011, I trekked with girlfriend to NYC’s Gramercy Theater to see System Divide, Three Inches Of Blood, Holy Grail and Eluveitie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a sidenote, this was my first trip to Gramercy Theater and I have to say that I was duly impressed. This is a slick looking venue. Several bars throughout, seating, standing room and a totally killer basement that really cries out for a fun dance night. Sadly the place didn’t offer a coat check, which was really odd and unfortunate given that it was pretty cold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Inches Of Blood, one of the openers that I’d wanted to see, was unfortunately stuck in an ice storm. Their van unable to haul them to the show in time and safely, the concert carried on without them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’d never heard of System Divide before, and I’ll grant that they had some rad t-shirts for sale. However, they are easily one of the worst bands I have ever heard live or recorded. Their music was stale, boring, predictable and relied upon every lame convention of metalcore. My girlfriend, who is by no means a metal aficionado and who also didn’t even know the term metalcore, was laughing about how predictable all their songs were. Horrible. If these fools ever open for another band I want to see, I will seriously consider avoiding the show in an attempt to keep them from continuing their careers as musicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Grail, however, were immensely fun. Before this show, I’d heard only a bit of their music and I really enjoyed it. On the surface, they sound a bit like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest or other traditional heavy metal bands and sing overtly about fantasy topics, one of my favorite things. They were extremely energetic, had wonderful musicianship and stage presence and were a pleasure to experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then, Eluveitie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I arrived a little late to the Eluveitie party, having not stumbled upon them until about a year ago. However, since first listen, I was enthralled. I have a strong predisposition for loving folk metal and I love the ethos Eluveitie brings to the genre. The Gaullish is a great addition to their music and so are the traditional instruments they use. If you’re unfamiliar with the band in general, I suggest that you acquaint yourself, and soon, because you, my friend, are missing out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their set was solid. I was impressed with their tightness, as I often am when I hear larger bands play live. Featuring a good deal more than the standard quartet arrangement and also incorporating non-traditional instruments, this is a band that does it right. I was also pleasantly surprised that their sound guy didn’t simply try to deafen us all. The mix was solid and it was easy to hear each of the instruments and voices play its own part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eluveitie played a great set, transitioning smartly between ballads and faster, harder songs. The crowd was on fire and virtually the entire floor turned into a pit. A crowd and fan favorite, “Inis Mona,” set the audience ablaze as did a singalong in Gaullish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set Eluveitie played was long and gratifying and was an excellent live set. However, this wasn’t a show that really lit me on fire as a whole. I’d definitely take the opportunity to see Eluveitie play live again and I’ll continue to love their albums, but there was no real point during the show that I felt a revelatory moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffburchett/sets/72157625906553387/with/5439080274/" target="_blank"&gt;Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-4595580471923887086?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900171403</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900171403</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2011 20:50:00 -0500</pubDate><category>live</category><category>three inches of blood</category><category>new york</category><category>holy grail</category><category>review</category><category>music</category><category>pictures</category><category>eluveitie</category><category>gramercy</category></item><item><title>Blog weirdness (update)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I think the blog’s weirdness is solved.

At this point, I’m not really making much of it public, as it’s still in pre-alpha rough draft form, but, I may post snippets of it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you or someone you know is a comic artist, please put me in touch.

I’m sure that you notice that there are some changes here on the main site and that the blog is (presently) full of formatting errors. Here’s the deal of what’s going on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, I have maintained multiple blogs spread around various hosts, chosen for their individual strengths to serve the needs of a particular blog. As you may infer, this was an awful lot like “work” and was not something that I wanted to carry on doing. What I have done, then, is compile my tumblr, Blogger and WordPress blogs all into one Blogger blog and am in the process of solving the issues of formatting and display that have resulted from skooching them all into one main location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What this means for you is, really, very little. My prattle will continue unabated and no more intelligent than ever. Sorry. The only thing you’ll be noticing is that there will no longer be a delineation between music, professional and other blogs. They’re all housed here under the same roof. So, you may have to scroll a little longer, or a little less, depending on whether you read one or both of the blogs I’d recently maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What it means for me is enormous. First and foremost, it’s $9 a month that I can reclaim for beer purchasing. That’s like an extra case of Pabst a month. The value of a case of beer is difficult to overstate. It also means that I will no longer be having to deal with WordPress, which is as wretched a system as I’ve used in some time. I’ll grant that it offers flexibility not found in most blogs, but it does so at the cost of so much hassle that it’s just not worth it. It requires updates all the time, it’s cranky, difficult and just not very good. It’s certainly no better than Blogger OR tumblr, just more versatile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, it’s Friday evening now and I’m done messing around with this thing. I’m hoping to have everything ship-shape by the end of the weekend. In the meantime, sorry for the interruption of service, just enjoy the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-1854053410193664531?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900170773</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900170773</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2011 21:46:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Two of my favorite bands that should be two of your favorite bands (too)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you about two of my favorite bands: Pelican and Russian Circles. Both of these delightful groups are instrumental, have what I would describe as a post-rock style with sludge-metal leanings and are patently awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suppose that some people may think that pairing these two groups together in a post makes sense. I mean, hell, they are both from Chicago and they do both play a sort of music that Chicago seems to breed and foster so well. But, truth is, I’d argue that it doesn’t. Well, not really. They both play a similar genre of music, though both approach it quite differently. Pelican tends to be a great deal more riff-centric whereas Russian Circles tends toward melody. I guess what they both are, really, is post-metal. Whatever. Who cares? I’m over it with labels anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, why am I pairing up these two aural behemoths of whom you’ve never heard? Simple. I spent today at work listening to both of them. Three albums each. Needless to say, it was a good day. But, here we go, I want to evangelize a bit for both of these groups. They’re grossly underrepresented and both absolutely magnificent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pelican is probably my favorite band. It’s really hard for me to choose one band as my favorite, but with a gun to my head, I’d say Pelican. I think. Their sound is very multi-layered, very heavy and tremendously atmospheric. Pelican is a band that is capable of evoking a mood, almost able to inject specific thoughts into a listener’s head merely by coaxing out a few chords and notes. Make no mistake, Pelican is heavy. It’s often oppressive, crushing stuff. And, strangely enough, it’s almost always beautiful. I mean that in the purest, most pristine way I can imagine. Their music strikes the balance between a lead weight and a feather, floating lightly on the breeze. It doesn’t feel contrived or out of place at all. It just works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Russian Circles tend more toward the post-rock side of things instead of the post-metal, I suppose. They form and foster intricate, slithering melodies that slip and dribble over the top of a gritty post-metal base. Russian Circles play captivating songs that feel like little stories. As a listener, you’re always left wondering where the journey will meander next. And the best part of it? The journey never, and I do mean never, leads somewhere you just don’t want to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are these two bands perfect? Hell no. But they’re both absolutely wonderful. Friends of mine with monumentally diverse tastes in music all find that these two bands have an inexplicable draw for them. It could be that most of my friends are relatively artistic types, it could be that they all just have great taste, but honestly, I’d bet it’s more about these bands being more transcendent than most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, I’ve whetted your appetite, right? Don’t worry, I won’t leave you hanging. Pelican’s discography is a bit lengthier than Russian Circles’s is. With Pelican, I’d suggest starting with their 2007 album City of Echoes. I’m not going to say that it’s their “best” album, but I will say that it’s certainly the most exemplary of their style and substance. It’s a great album that doesn’t have a single track worth skipping and it’s a wonderful place to get your feet wet with them. The song “Spaceship Broken-Parts Needed” is a personal favorite and a standout on the album.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for Russian Circles, the choices are fewer. My pick for a place to start with them is their newest offering, Geneva, from 2009. Their first album tended to be relatively heavy, while their second was much less so. On their third, they seem to have really found their niche and stride. It contains songs that ebb and flow, shrink and grow and leave you feeling a sort of catharsis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, what are you waiting for? Get moving! Both of these bands deserve your support. Both work hard and both produce exceptional music, both put on wonderful live shows and both need a couple bucks from you to keep offering the great art that they make and share with us. So pick up an album, buy a tshirt or go to a show. You’ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-6071239630938061507?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900170458</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900170458</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2011 20:57:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Happy birthday, Professor!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I should have posted this yesterday. I didn’t. I feel legitimately bad about it. The strange thing is that I’m pretty certain not that many people will read this, and of course the subject is dead, but still, it just feels wrong to be late. January 3 is J.R.R. Tolkien’s birthday. He would have been 119, a fairly good run, I’d say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tolkien wrote some books, you may have heard of them. He envisioned a little place called Middle Earth and he filled it up with amazing, fantastic people and places and things and languages and history and myths and heroes and villains and amazing victories and crushing defeat and laughter and tears and love and hate and everything else in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He shaped our world. He did more to change the notion of fiction as a story telling art, arguably, than anyone ever has. His alternate worlds were so completely and compellingly filled that there are quite literally scholars of Middle Earth and it’s history. Read that again. Not scholars of Tolkien’s works, scholars of his worlds. The man created whole and functional languages and built societies around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He showed the world what it is to craft a universe and create something from imagination. He single handedly created the genre of high fantasy, which has paved the way for amazing films, video games, tabletop games and other authors of amazing (though never comparable) worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hanta, Professor. We miss you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-8165009165448798481?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900170138</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900170138</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2011 21:43:00 -0500</pubDate><category>tolkien</category></item><item><title>My 2011 wish list</title><description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I want this year. And, of course, I’ll probably get very few of them because that’s just the way things usually work out. Well, whatever. Maybe I’ll at least be able to wrangle a new hi-fi and some nice speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, this is my list of things that I want this 2011, musically speaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. I want everyone to realize that Vampire Weekend is complete and utter trash. It sounds like children’s Saturday morning television programming played by hipsters. Just because it’s weird doesn’t mean it’s good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1b. I want these guys to break up and stop making more awful racket. I could honestly stop here. That would be enough to make 2011 a pretty solid year musically. But I’m greedy, so I’m just going to carry on making demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Pelican: make another album. Make it as heavy as WWACTN and as atmospheric as TFIOTWBTT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Japandroids: make another album.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. New York City: how about we have some places to hear live music here? Ok, let me clarify that. Let’s have some places to hear live music that isn’t pop, house or generally speaking detritus. Where are the metal, punk and rock places? Yeah, Williamsburg has a few places to go, but sorry, that’s just too far away. Midtown! I’m lookin’ at you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Ossining, NY: step it up and get a hipster metal community going. I’m perfectly willing to put in the legwork to help, but damn, this place is utterly devoid of musical tinkerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Some rapper somewhere who isn’t Jay-Z, Kanye West, TI or Aesop Rock MAKE SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH A SHIT. Please. Hip-hop has become worse than throw-away. It’s as bad as pop now. Actually, no. It is pop, it’s just more irritating to listen to than sugarcoated pop. Anyway, we all know about your jets, your money, your bitches and hoes, how tough you think you are and that you know English only a TINY bit better than I know Chinese (hint: I DO NOT KNOW CHINESE). Now, find your brains, learn to speak and think and produce some intelligent, interesting hip-hop worthy of people’s time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Kvelertak: please make EPs. I want, I don’t know, like, uh, three of them. Yeah, three EPs, no LPs. Frequent release of smaller stuff is better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. Apple: make Garage Band not suck. I’m not trying to do hardly ANYTHING with it and it’s too gimpy to do it. So make it better. You guys are too good to put out such worthless bloatware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. Some phone company somewhere please, please, please, please, PLEASE make a microphone on a phone that doesn’t sound like it’s in a blast furnace when I try to record my favorite song at a show. Seriously. It’s not actually hard to do this, you’re just being lazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10. I hope to carry on through 2011 being unable to recognize a Justin Beiber song. My girlfriend listens to Z100 in her car, so I’m pretty sure that I’ve accidentally heard one, but I couldn’t discern him from your mom on the radio, and I plan on keeping it that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11. Mainstream media: stop plucking up indie music and hipsters and putting them into your ads. Seriously. You are not cooler for doing this. You do not appeal to a broader base or age range, you just look inauthentic. Cadillac, you are to blame for this and I hate you.&lt;br/&gt;Yep, that’s about it for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-8418382807491456656?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900169820</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900169820</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2011 20:51:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Happy New Year!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Happy 2011 to all of you. I hope this year is better for you than the last and not as good as the next!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, as is my custom, I plan to make no resolutions. It seems to me that the notion of a New Year’s Resolution is patently akin to the notion of going on a diet. It’s something that you start, that may end. I prefer to make changes that last. Evolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyhow, if you have chosen to make a resolution this year, here’s hoping you’re able to stick with it!

Arcade Fire - The Suburbs&lt;br/&gt;Arcade Fire have been on a steady track toward being one of the best pop rock acts out there since their quiet emergence some years ago. This album shows that they’ve been developing consistently, and The Suburbs shows them with a very strong, confident voice, communicating to their listeners about the things they really, truly know. This is a beautiful, catchy, heart-wrenching album, and it absolutely deserves your attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&lt;br/&gt;I have long been convinced than Kanye West has more talent in his pinky finger than the rest of mainstream pop put together. His bombastic (insane?) personal debacles have unjustly overshadowed his monumental talent as both a composer and producer. The tracks on this extremely memorable album are products of both his writing and production skills. The lyrics are smart and steer away from the oft-overwrought ground of most hip-hop and, for my money, this album is a true standout among a heap of utterly lackluster hip-hop releases this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. Swans - My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky&lt;br/&gt;I don’t know really how one should classify Swans as a band. Sometimes they strike me as metal, other times as punk and still other times as something I just can’t pin down. I’m going to say this album is hard avant noise rock, and I think that’s pretty accurate. Swans succeed here in treading bizarre, beautiful and compelling ground that other bands fear to explore. The album works exceptionally well as a whole and is one of the most engaging pieces I’ve heard this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Cloudkicker - Beacons&lt;br/&gt;I first heard Cloudkicker this year. I’m honestly not even certain how I came across this act, but I am eternally grateful that I did. Beacons is an intense assault of instrumental metal. It’s also kind of pretty and oddly very catchy and hummable. This album is thrilling, in the sense that it will literally get your heart rate up and get your hands sweaty and make you brace for what’s next in all the best ways. It is absolutely not to be missed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Agalloch - Marrow of the Spirit&lt;br/&gt;This album and the rest on this list could have tied for the number one spot, really. I’ve probably reshuffled their order a dozen times or more, but at some point, you’ve just really got to say “enough is enough.” Agalloch is black metal. It’s extremely arty black metal with theatrical and electronic influence. It’s also the most gnashing, heinous thing you’ll ever call beautiful. I know that’s bound to sound like the most backhanded compliment ever, but this album is legitimately incredible. It needs to be listened to from start to finish, uninterrupted in the dark with big, glorious headphones. And then you will understand. This is art, pure and simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. School of Seven Bells - Disconnect From Desire&lt;br/&gt;Cocteau Twins offshoot School of Seven Bells offers up a great, fun shoegazey, dream-poppy album full of catchy lines, great writing and a sound that is aware of its almost-retro styling without being dated or kitschy. A truly great album.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Los Campesinos! - Romance is Boring&lt;br/&gt;I heard this album the day it was released and I loved it. It has honestly powerful lyrics, evocative of the life I know, the life my friends know. This album is real. It masks nothing. The musical lines in it are expertly tuned arrangements for a rather large band. Taken as a unit, I’m inclined to say that rock doesn’t really get a lot better than this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Titus Andronicus - The Monitor&lt;br/&gt;Let me just blow your mind for a moment, ok? Titus Andronicus aims, on The Monitor, to use the American Civil War as a metaphor for the trials and tribulations, the monetary disenfranchisement and the jaded beliefs of American twenty-somethings in 2010. Yeah, that’s right, so just let that marinate for a moment. This album is a sodding drunk Bruce Springsteen getting his nerd on and thrashing out epic punk ballads. This is the ethos and the pathos all in one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Kvelertak - Kvelertak&lt;br/&gt;As you may remember from my review of this album earlier this year, I was pretty immediately smitten by Kvelertak’s beguiling serenade. In June, I wrote&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Kvelertak is what would happen if Converge and Blut Aus Nord got drunk together and started playing Sex Pistols covers transcribed into Norwegian by The Rolling Stones with a little help from Baroness. &lt;/blockquote&gt;I stand by this still. This album has only grown on me, has further shown me its subtleties and proven that it is not only one of the best albums of this year, but a paragon of its genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Drudkh - Handful of Stars&lt;br/&gt;It’s been an outstanding year for black metal, especially beautiful, atmospheric black metal. Drudkh is very folkloric, drawing deeply from Ukranian history and mythos to inspire both their sound and lyrics. Unlike much black metal, Drudkh (and Agalloch, too) to their credit are not preaching entropy and utterly childish drivel. These are lovingly crafted, beautiful songs about loving the beautiful countryside, the legends of time gone by and the troubles of a long-suffering people. Drawing frequently from Ukranian poetry and literature, this album is an artistic triumph that proves that Drudkh is not only producing amazing music, but that they are doing so within a context that they understand. This album is marvelously self-aware, honest and very convincing. If you can make it happen, listen to this outside, under a starry sky, away from the city. And there, let this album reveal itself to you.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-2889743677024265763?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900169168</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900169168</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2010 20:49:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Yelp! matters more than Facebook or Twitter</title><description>&lt;p&gt;For the very reason that most marketers don’t really want to get into it with Yelp!, it’s the single most important social media outlet there is. It may not be the biggest and it may not reach the most people, but its impact is greater than Facebook or Twitter for business by a degree of magnitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why? It’s impartial. Of course there are seedy businesses out there that buy reviews and positive ratings, but we can’t really include those in a reasonable discussion. Yelp! is impartial. It’s completely crowd-sourced. Yelp! isn’t about letting your company reach its audience. Yelp! is, however, about empowering the crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social media is the crowd. It’s just that most marketers haven’t quite gotten that yet. When you have a single, unified forum that provides objective data of subjective reviews, you have a powerful, powerful tool that can make or break a business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And let’s just face it. Most business is small business. Aunt Suzy’s Cookie Company isn’t ever going to have 142,239 organic fans on Facebook if she stays local. And a lot of companies think that just because they’re local or smaller that social media isn’t a valuable tool, but they’re wrong. Yelp! is the very distilled essence of what I blogged about yesterday. It’s word of mouth. It’s the most desirable form of advertising. It’s also the quickest and deadliest poison out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the real question is, “how do I utilize Yelp! or other similar forums?” Really, it boils down to two easy steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Be better at what you do. No matter what it is, improve it. If you’re already the best, widen the gap. Listen to your customers, find out what they want, and find a way to make it happen profitably. Get innovative, use your brain! You don’t get to be the best damned cookie company out there by resting on your chocolate chip laden laurels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Encourage people to engage in social media about you. Get yourself up on Yelp! and plaster your place with those “People love us on Yelp!” stickers. Incentivize people if you have to. Offer discounts to them for posting ANY review of your business, positive or negative. You’ll learn from the bad and benefit from the good. When you’ve fixed the problems, respond on Yelp! and let people know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key thing is to get people talking. Remember, that’s the whole social bit of social media. It’s not just about you communicating with your audience, it’s about getting your audience involved with itself in a community, a society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facebook and Twitter are great, but people have to find you first. Yelp! and other similar review sites will help get you found. And getting found is the first step to creating a legion of fanboys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-280412148193524964?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900168810</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900168810</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2010 20:58:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Social media is neither new nor innovative</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Got your attention now, don’t I?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here’s the thing: that’s a true statement. Social media is just a new term that describes what is probably the oldest form of marketing known to man. Consider this: a baker in the middle ages didn’t really have any means of advertising. Most people were illiterate, so it’s not like the guy was making up little flyers with discount coupons on them. So how did Baker A steal business from Baker B? Simple. By baking better bread, developing better relationships with customers and creating a legion of bread devotees who would tell their friends that Baker A’s bread was the bee’s knees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, social media has become a buzzword. If you ask me, it’s a pretty crap buzzword, to be honest. Facebook, Twitter and the others have made social marketing global and have definitely facilitated reaching untold droves of people a lot easier, and they’ve changed the game to an extent, but the core of what social media endeavors to accomplish remains unchanged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s really all about developing a positive relationship with people. Word of mouth is—hands down—the best advertising you can ever do. People trust their friends’ opinions and they seek out those opinions. The more fanboys you have, the better your business will do. If you have enough fanboys, depending on your market, it’s pretty likely that you actually don’t need any other advertising at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question really should be, “How can I build a credible relationship with my customers/clients in such a way that they’ll trust me and my business and evangelize for me?” And the answer is pretty simple. Social media (gah, I hate that phrase, but I’m just going to have to accept using it, I guess) is a two-way street. You know that friend of yours who’s always gibbering on about the new gadget s/he’s just bought? That friend is annoying as hell and we all do our best to ignore that person as much as possible. Don’t be that friend. And we’ve all got a friend who chimes in with pertinent and helpful advice, too. That’s the friend you want to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just think of your customers and clients as your friends. If you’re constantly trying to ram advertising down their gullets, you’re being the friend that everyone hates. Don’t be that guy. Instead, share things that you know your friends will be interested in. The internet has made this an incredibly simple task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let’s say you’re a baker, right? If all you do on your social media front is tell people about sales you’re having, remind them to buy a cake or pie for Christmas and prattle on endlessly about your business, your’e doing it wrong. But, it’s a fairly safe bet to assume that anyone who’s willing to engage a bakery on a social media level is pretty gaga for baked goods. Share recipes with them, link some posts from Cakewrecks and get them involved in a discussion around things that you can deduce they peripherally like due to their interest in your business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need a goal and a plan to get there, but social media is not as precise as something like direct mail. If your goal with DM is to drop a million flyers and get a 1% response rate, that’s measurable. Your goal with social media should be to prove to your followers that you’re a credible source of things that they’re interested in and to make certain that they have a lot of good stuff to say about you in their discussions of your product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROI doesn’t apply in the same ways that many marketers are used to. Social media is both a marketing tool and also a forum to learn about yourself and your business. Oftentimes, the most helpful data you’ll glean from your social interactions with your followers is what you’re doing wrong. The key is not to argue with them or assume an indignant stance but rather to adjust what you’re doing accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just remember, social media is just a fad term that describes what the best businesses have always done. They’ve set the stage to create a cult following, enabled the discussion of their good or service and helped to build a real community of enthusiasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, fanboys can be irritating, but they go a long way toward helping cultivate new consumers of whatever it is you’re offering. And the single easiest and best way to turn buyers into fangirls and boys is by engaging them on a level they find to be valuable and meaningful. Remember: it doesn’t always have to sound like marketing your business to be marketing your business. Sometimes, the best way to sell a loaf of bread is to share some disastrous pictures of cakes gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-7305234399160728609?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900168436</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900168436</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2010 20:57:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Woops! I vanished.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Oh man. The last 6 months have been insane. And by insane I mean something akin to clinically batshit. So here’s my long-winded excuse for failling to post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I lost my job on April 30, 2010. My contract was supposed to end on May 31, 2010, but it ended a month early and unemployment hit me like a ton of bricks. I spent the entire summer hunting feverishly for a new job with no luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also realized that I had fallen in love with my best friend and about a month ago, I moved to New York to be with her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wow. A lot, I know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what now? Well, I’d like to continue this blog, obviously. But it’s going to be from a New York perspective now. Anyone know any sweet NYC places to hear good indie and metal? I’m in Ossining, NY, now but I can get to the city easily enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catch you soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3947637006065839056-1751623674317574897?l=ciemnika.blogspot.com" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900168116</link><guid>http://ciemnika.tumblr.com/post/3900168116</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2010 20:48:00 -0500</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
