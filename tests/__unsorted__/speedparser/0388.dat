<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=shatteparadi-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1637" title="Occupy Wall Street" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Occupy-Wall-Street-300x227.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" /></a>Is Occupy Wall Street going to represent a major turning point in U.S. history?  Over the past several years, many people have been warning that we would see mass economic riots in the United States if the economy continued to get worse.  Well, the economic riots are now here and America will never be the same.  The Occupy Wall Street protests are starting their third week and now similar protests have sprung up in major cities all over the United States.  An increasing number of Americans have totally lost faith in the system and are looking for an outlet for their frustrations.  Occupy Wall Street is a spark that has started a fire, but most Americans do not understand where all of this is going.  In the years ahead, millions more Americans will lose their jobs, millions more Americans will lose their homes to foreclosure and millions more Americans will find themselves drowning in debt.  As the economy continues to decline, millions upon millions of Americans will become even more frustrated.  In particular, young Americans <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-mad-as-hell-generation-20-reasons-why-millions-of-americans-under-the-age-of-30-are-giving-up-on-the-u-s-economy">are really starting to become angry</a> about the economy and our deeply corrupt financial system.  Eventually we are going to see an explosion of anger and frustration on the streets of America that is going to be absolutely unprecedented.  Occupy Wall Street is just the beginning.  If most Americans could see what is coming next, it would chill them to their cores.</p>
<p>Growing up, most of us were taught that if we wanted to change things in America, we could do it at the ballot box.  Well, today large numbers of Americans are realizing that both major political parties have been bought and paid for.  They are realizing that things never seem to change no matter who we vote into office.  They are realizing that signing petitions or sending letters to our "representatives" does not accomplish anything.</p>
<p>As the frustration of average Americans has grown, it has given rise to new political movements.</p>
<p>So far, the Tea Party movement has been the most prominent, and it has been dominated mostly by Republicans.</p>
<p>Now, Occupy Wall Street is becoming a national movement, and it is being dominated mostly by radical leftists and socialists.</p>
<p>Both movements have attempted to appeal to the growing core of libertarians in this country, and to a certain extent both movements have had some success.</p>
<p>But what all of this represents is a fundamental shift in the way that Americans view political change.</p>
<p>Americans no longer trust that politicians will listen to them.  All of the recent polls show that satisfaction with the government is at an all-time low.  People are deeply frustrated and large numbers of them simply do not believe that the traditional ways of bringing about change work anymore.</p>
<p>America is broken, and it is getting really hard to deny it.</p>
<p>In America today, it takes massive amounts of money to get elected, and most of our politicians end up deeply aligned with those that have huge amounts of money to donate to political campaigns.</p>
<p>Most Americans today feel like they have no voice.  Many also feel like they do not have a legitimate choice at the ballot box.</p>
<p>So what happens when millions of Americans are deeply, deeply angry about the economy and the direction this country is headed, but they also believe that the political system is so broken that voting won't do any good?</p>
<p>Well, we are starting to see what happens.</p>
<p>Today, people are marching non-violently in the streets.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, unfortunately, things are likely to get much crazier.  Violence is not the solution to any of our problems, but sadly that is the direction we are headed as a nation.  Those that are angry and frustrated tend to lash out in wild and unpredictable ways.  We saw that during the London riots recently.</p>
<p>It would be great if a couple of "quick fixes" could be implemented and all of our economic problems would go away.  But the reality of the situation is that the problems that we are facing are far more complicated than that.  The truth is that the United States is in the midst of a long-term economic decline which is getting progressively worse, and this country has become <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/divide-and-conquer-are-the-left-and-the-right-in-america-about-to-go-to-war-with-each-other">deeply, deeply divided</a>.</p>
<p>There is not much hope on the horizon and time is rapidly running out for our economy.</p>
<p>So will the Occupy Wall Street protests bring about change?</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of things that are very unusual about the Occupy Wall Street protests.</p>
<p>One of the unique things about the Occupy Wall Street protests is that they are focused on money and economics.  In the past, most mass protests in America have been about war or civil rights, but the Occupy Wall Street movement is very much focused on the <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-future-for-most-americans-pathetic-jobs-bad-debts-and-a-crappy-economy">economic pain</a> that ordinary Americans are feeling.</p>
<p>It is also very unusual for liberals to be conducting mass protests while a liberal is sitting in the White House.</p>
<p>So if this is what is happening now, what is going to happen once a Republican gets elected?</p>
<p>That is a very sobering thing to think about.</p>
<p>At first, a lot of people thought that the Occupy Wall Street protests would quickly fade away.</p>
<p>But they haven't.</p>
<p>Instead, they have grown and they have spread to more cities.</p>
<p>For example, the other day <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/01/dozens-arrested-at-bank-america-headquarters-in-boston/">3,000 people</a> protested in front of Bank of America's offices in downtown Boston.</p>
<p>Similar protests are now being held <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2011/09/28/occupy-wall-street-spreads-san-francisco">in San Francisco</a>, <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/202182.html">in Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-poverty-protest-20111002,0,7183766.story">in Los Angeles</a>, <a href="http://www.q13fox.com/news/kcpq-more-than-100-turn-out-for-anticorporate-protest-20111001,0,788683.story?track=rss">in Seattle</a>, and <a href="http://www.9news.com/news/local/article/222412/346/Occupy-Denver-speaks-out-against-Wall-Street-">in Denver</a>.</p>
<p>But of course New York is still the epicenter of the movement, and what happened on the Brooklyn Bridge the other day made headlines all over the globe.</p>
<p>Police arrested more than 700 people under very suspicious circumstances.  The arrests on the Brooklyn Bridge appear to have been a staged event by the police.  If you doubt this, just read <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/02/occupy-wall-street-arrests-eyewitness-view_n_990857.html">this eyewitness account</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fockzr7rXys&amp;feature=channel_video_title">this video</a>, the police led the protesters on to the bridge and then stopped and formed a line in the middle of the bridge.  When protesters attempted to turn around and leave in the other direction, they found that there were police behind them.  Surrounded and with no way out, most of the protesters just waited to be cuffed and hauled off by police.</p>
<p>So was it the goal of the police to make the protesters look bad by making it look like they were blockading the Brooklyn Bridge?</p>
<p>Did someone that wanted to provide fuel for these protests organize this "media event" so that large numbers of Americans would sympathize with the protesters and would want to rally to their cause?</p>
<p>Something about that whole Brooklyn Bridge episode just feels really "staged".</p>
<p>In any event, it appears likely that the Occupy Wall Street movement is not going anywhere any time soon.</p>
<p>So exactly what do they want?</p>
<p>Well, the following list of complaints was taken <a href="http://nycga.cc/">from the "official" organizing website</a> of Occupy Wall Street....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.</em></p>
<p><em>They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.</em></p>
<p><em>They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one’s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.</em></p>
<p><em>They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.</em></p>
<p><em>They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless animals, and actively hide these practices.</em></p>
<p><em>They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.</em></p>
<p><em>They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.</em></p>
<p><em>They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers’ healthcare and pay.</em></p>
<p><em>They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.</em></p>
<p><em>They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.</em></p>
<p><em>They have sold our privacy as a commodity.</em></p>
<p><em>They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press. They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.</em></p>
<p><em>They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.</em></p>
<p><em>They have donated large sums of money to politicians, who are responsible for regulating them.</em></p>
<p><em>They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.</em></p>
<p><em>They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save people’s lives or provide relief in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantial profit.</em></p>
<p><em>They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.</em><br />
<em> They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.</em></p>
<p><em>They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.</em></p>
<p><em>They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad. They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.</em></p>
<p><em>They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You will notice that a lot of populist and libertarian themes have been mixed in with a lot of the causes that radical leftists and socialists typically support.</p>
<p>So exactly who is behind Occupy Wall Street?</p>
<p>Well, the truth is that some very familiar names are associated with this "grassroots" movement.</p>
<p>A recent article <a href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=334433#ixzz1ZdMFNNxu">posted on WorldNetDaily</a> fingered ACORN founder Wade Rathke and SEIU board member Stephen Lerner as two of the leaders of the Occupy Wall Street movement....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In March, ACORN founder Wade Rathke announced what he called "days of rage in ten cities around JP Morgan Chase." Rathke was president of an SEIU local in New Orleans.</em></p>
<p><em>The planned Sept. 17 protest seems to be the culmination of Rathke's efforts.</em></p>
<p><em>Those efforts are being organized by Stephen Lerner, an SEIU board member who reportedly visited the Obama White House at least four times.</em></p>
<p><em>Lerner is considered one of the most capable organizers of the radical left.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The sad truth is that the Occupy Wall Street movement is not something new.  The vast majority of the protesters <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFVR9Nv43J4">seem to be Obama supporters</a>, and there is little evidence that many of the protesters have broken out of the false left/right political paradigm that dominates our political system.</p>
<p>Most of the participants in the Occupy Wall Street movement openly talk about how much they admire Barack Obama, and yet <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cid=N00009638">3 of the top 7 donors</a> to Obama's campaign in 2008 were the very Wall Street banks that the Occupy Wall Street movement is protesting.</p>
<p>Obama's administration is littered with people that used to work for big Wall Street banks, and Obama has been really good to Wall Street.</p>
<p>So if the Occupy Wall Street movement was really serious about change, they would be openly protesting Obama.</p>
<p>But you don't see too many anti-Obama signs out there, now do you?</p>
<p>It would be really nice if the Occupy Wall Street movement was truly a non-political movement that was focused on bringing economic justice back to this country.</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that it was started by far left political groups, and a lot more very liberal organizations are now jumping on board.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of very frustrated Americans are going to get involved in these protests without even realizing who is organizing them.</p>
<p>According to a recent article <a href="http://blog.alexanderhiggins.com/2011/09/29/game-collective-group-1-million-members-expected-join-occupy-wall-street-protest-73051/">by blogger Alexander Higgins</a>, quite a few very prominent unions are now throwing their support behind Occupy Wall Street....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As I previously reported <a href="http://blog.alexanderhiggins.com/2011/09/29/nationwide-member-twu-transport-workers-union-vote-72521/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>unions are coming out in full force to support the Occupy Wall Street protests</strong></a>. We received news that the 200,000 member strong Transportation Workers Union would be joining the protests. The Teamster’s union endorsed the protests. Rumors of Verizon workers joining the protests. A scathing endorsement was issued by the Industrial Workers Union has also endorsed the Occupy Wall Street protests. Then news that several more unions had committed to or were contemplating joining the protests, while two the unions scheduled solidarity marches.</em></p>
<p><em>Now TPM reports even more unions are joining up to protest against Wall Street and the movement is set to grow rapidly.</em></p>
<p><em>The article also comes along with the news that a collective of 8 groups, with over 1 million members will be joining the Occupy Wall Street movement to show solidarity and march against the machine.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Reportedly, October 5th is being targeted as a day for mass protests to be held all around the country.</p>
<p>If the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Tea Party movement joined together to protest the abuses of the Federal Reserve and the abuses of Wall Street they would be a very powerful force.</p>
<p>But instead, the Occupy Wall Street movement considers the Tea Party movement to be the enemy.</p>
<p>Just consider what some very prominent leftist leaders have said recently....</p>
<p>*<a title="Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6gHfhwShhA" target="_blank">Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa</a> recently stated that he is ready for "war" with the Tea Party....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"We got to keep an eye on the battle that we face: the war on workers. And you see it everywhere, it is the Tea Party. And you know, there is only one way to beat and win that war. The one thing about working people is we like a good fight. And you know what? They’ve got a war, they got a war with us and there’s only going to be one winner."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>He also added the following during his recent speech....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"President Obama, this is your army. We are ready to march. Let's take these son of a bitches out and give America back to an America where we belong"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>*Some leftist leaders believe that it is time for "war".  The following is from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=W5aLKyh93bo">a recent speech</a> by The New Black Panther Party National Chairman Malik Shabazz....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have to fight. Gird up your loins college students. Gird up your loins young black man and young black woman, for the hour of war is at hand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>*Instead of working with the them, the following is what <a title="Maxine Waters" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqFIb0uVZrs" target="_blank">Maxine Waters</a> recently had to say about the Tea Party....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"As far as I’m concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course a lot of Republicans would rather lose a limb than work with people like Jimmy Hoffa and Maxine Waters.</p>
<p>We are a country that is deeply divided and we seem to love to fight with one another.</p>
<p>Most Americans are deeply, deeply frustrated, but very few of us agree on what the solutions to our problems are.</p>
<p>Whenever a new protest movement arises, Americans tend to flock to it because they are searching for something that they can finally believe in.</p>
<p>Right now the Occupy Wall Street movement is fresh and new.  <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/9214-unions-socialists-join-forces-to-occupy-wall-street">Michael Moore</a> was right when he said the following about the movement....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"These numbers will grow and they’re going to grow all across the country."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There are millions and millions of deeply frustrated Americans out there, and any movement that arises that seems to address their concerns is going to draw followers.</p>
<p>The banksters certainly seem alarmed about the growth of protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street.</p>
<p>For example, JPMorgan Chase recently donated <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/article/ny-13.htm?TB_iframe=true&amp;height=580&amp;width=850">over 4 and a half million dollars</a> to the New York City Police Foundation....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>JPMorgan Chase recently donated an unprecedented $4.6 million to the New York City Police Foundation. The gift was the largest in the history of the foundation and will enable the New York City Police Department to strengthen security in the Big Apple.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Do you really think that JPMorgan Chase just did that out of the kindness of their hearts?</p>
<p>As movements like Occupy Wall Street grow, law enforcement authorities will crack down on them harder and harder.</p>
<p>In fact, we have already seen some very disturbing incidents during the recent protests.  For example, most of you have already probably seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moD2JnGTToA&amp;feature=related">this video</a> of a police officer spraying mace directly into the faces of helpless female protesters.</p>
<p>It is almost unbelievable that such things are happening in America.</p>
<p>But things are going to get much worse than this.</p>
<p>The frustration of those on the left is going to continue to grow.</p>
<p>The frustration of those on the right is going to continue to grow.</p>
<p>In the years ahead we are going to see mass economic riots that are going to make Occupy Wall Street look like a Sunday picnic.</p>
<p>In response, the powers that be are going to use law enforcement more aggressively than ever in an attempt to exert control.</p>
<p>All of this is going to make many of our large cities hellish place to be.</p>
<p>The "coming economic riots" have now arrived.</p>
<p>America will never be the same again.</p>
<p>According to one recent poll, <a title="39 percent of Americans" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/39-percent-of-americans-believe-the-us-economy-is-in-permanent-decline-2011-6" target="_blank">39 percent of Americans</a> now believe that the U.S. economy has entered a state of "permanent decline".</p>
<p>Our nation is falling apart and we are already seeing the frustration of the American people boil over in some very strange ways.  For much more on this growing phenomenon please see the following articles....</p>

<p>Once upon a time, our founders thought that they were guaranteeing our freedoms by adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution.</p>
<p>But today there are a lot of freedoms that we simply do not have any longer.</p>
<p>In America today, you do not have the right to say whatever you want.  If you say the wrong thing on a blog or a website it can have dramatic consequences.</p>
<p>In America today, you do not have the right to do raise your own children as you see fit.</p>
<p>In America today, you do not have the right to grow whatever food you want and you do not have the right to eat whatever food you do grow.</p>
<p>In America today, you do not have the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.</p>
<p>In America today, you do not have a right to privacy.  In fact, you should expect that everything that you do is watched, tracked, monitored and recorded.</p>
<p>If you doubt any of the statements above, just check out the examples posted below.</p>
<p>The following are 12 signs that Americans who love liberty and freedom should watch their backs....</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> A 55-year-old man in Arizona was recently ordered to turn in all his guns because of things that he wrote on his blog.  Fortunately, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=349713">after WorldNetDaily covered the story</a> there was an outpouring of outrage and the order was overturned, but what would have happened if WorldNetDaily had not covered the story?</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> According to <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/033717_CDC_National_Immunization_Survey.html">Mike Adams of Natural News</a>, the CDC is starting to call parents all over the nation to question them about the vaccination status of their children....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which has been comprehensively exposed as a vaccine propaganda organization promoting the interests of drug companies, is now engaged in a household surveillance program that involves calling U.S. households and intimidating parents into producing child immunization records. As part of what it deems a National Immunization Survey(NIS), the CDC is sending letters to U.S. households, alerting them that they will be called by "NORC at the University of Chicago" and that households should "have your child's immunization records handy when answering our questions."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You can see a copy of the letter that the CDC is sending out to selected parents <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/images/CDC-Letter-1.jpg">right here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> According to blogger Alexander Higgins, students in kindergarten and the 1st grade in the state of New Jersey are now required by law to participate "in monthly anti-terrorism drills".  The following is an excerpt <a href="http://cdn1.alexanderhiggins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Notification-Of-Terrorism-Drills-For-NJ-Public-School-Students.jpg">from a letter</a> that he recently received from the school where his child attends....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Each month a school must conduct one fire drill and one security drill which may be a lockdown, bomb threat, evacuation, active shooter, or shelter-in place drill. All schools are now required by law to implement this procedure.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So who in the world ever decided that it would be a good idea for 1st grade students to endure "lockdown" and "active shooter" drills?</p>
<p>To get an idea of what these kinds of drills are like, just check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbWjX9pZs0s&amp;feature=player_embedded">this video</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> According to licensed private investigator Angela V. Woodhull, hospitals are increasingly using "guardianship" to strip elderly Americans of their liberty and to rapidly drain their bank accounts.  The following is one story that Woodhull included <a href="http://theintelhub.com/2011/09/14/the-hospital-gestapo-you-may-never-see-home-again/">in a recent article</a>....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ginger Franklin, Hendersonville, Tennessee, fell down the stairs in her condo and suffered a bump on her head.  She was declared “temporarily mentally incapacitated” and a guardian was appointed through the courts.  <a href="http://www.wsmv.com/story/15205936/woman-files-complaint-against-judge#.TlSfAuCedMY.blogger">Within six weeks, the guardian had sold Franklin’s home, car, furniture, and drained her bank account</a>.  Today, Franklin has her freedom back, but she is having to start all over.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#5</strong> In a sign of just how far individual liberty in the United States has declined, a judge in Wisconsin has actually ruled that citizens do not have a right to grow and eat whatever foods they want to.  The following is <a href="http://www.thecompletepatient.com/storage/WIorder-clarification9-11.pdf">a short excerpt</a> from his recent decision....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>1) no, Plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to own and use a dairy cow or a dairy herd;</em></p>
<p><em>2) no, Plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to consume the milk from their own cow;</em></p>
<p><em>3) no, Plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to board their cow at the farm of a farmer;</em></p>
<p><em>4) no, the Zinniker Plaintiffs’ private contract does not fall outside the scope of the State’s police power;</em></p>
<p><em>5) no, Plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to produce and consume foods of their choice;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#6</strong> The freedom to raise our pets as we want to is also being greatly curtailed in many areas of the country.  For example, a new law in St. Louis would require nearly all dogs and cats to be sterilized and microchipped....</p>
<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://stlouis-mo.gov/internal-apps/legislative/upload/boardbill/BB107.pdf">Board Bill 107</a> would require all pet owners to spay or neuter their dogs and cats and microchip them for identification. Those who don't want to sterilize their pets would be assessed a fee of $200 per year.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Will the control freaks that run things want to start sterilizing and microchipping humans someday?</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> Whenever any politician suggests that we should "suspend elections", that should be a major red flag.  North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue recently <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/184199-nc-gov-proposes-suspending-congressional-elections-so-legislators-can-focus-on-economy">made national headlines</a> when she made the following statement....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"I think we ought to suspend, perhaps, elections for Congress for two years and just tell them we won't hold it against them, whatever decisions they make, to just let them help this country recover</em>"</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#8</strong> As I wrote about recently, many NFL teams are now performing "<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/enhanced-pat-downs-at-nfl-games-america-is-rapidly-turning-into-a-high-security-prison">enhanced pat-downs</a>" of fans before they enter the stadiums.  In Green Bay, the Packers are using <a href="http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20110928/APC0101/109280515/Packers-security-use-TSA-hand-held-wands-boost-Lambeau-safety">hand-held metal detectors</a> on fans before they are allowed to enter Lambeau field.</p>
<p>What is next?  Will they soon insist that we all undergo full body cavity searches before we are permitted to attend the games?</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Many Americans have complained about the horrible treatment that they are receiving at U.S. airports, but now the TSA is bringing their brand of "security" to many other locations throughout America as well.</p>
<p>TSA "VIPR teams" now conduct approximately <a title="8,000 &quot;unannounced security screenings&quot;" href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/06/tsa-swarms-8000-bus-stations-public-transit-systems-yearly" target="_blank">8,000 "unannounced security screenings"</a> a year at subway stations, bus terminals, ports and highway rest stops.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> Many of our public schools are now being run like prisons.  In fact, in many areas of the country, little kids are being publicly arrested by police <a title="in their own classrooms" href="../archives/18-signs-that-life-in-u-s-public-schools-is-now-essentially-equivalent-to-life-in-u-s-prisons">in their own classrooms</a> and are being marched out of their schools in handcuffs.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> If you think that anything that you do on the Internet is private, you should guess again.  It has recently come out that Facebook continues to track most of the websites that you visit <a href="http://www.infowars.com/cias-facebook-knows-where-you-go-on-the-web/">even after you have logged out of Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, law enforcement agencies all over the globe are increasingly viewing social media as a law enforcement tool.  For example, the NYPD recently created <a title="a special &quot;social media&quot; unit" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/10/2011-08-10_nypd_forms_new_social_media_unit_to_mine_facebook_and_twitter_for_mayhem.html" target="_blank">a special "social media" unit</a> dedicated to looking for criminals on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Also, many large organizations are now setting us very sophisticated systems that keep track of what is being said about them online and who is saying it.  For example, the new "<a title="Social Media Monitoring Solution" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66281284/Frbny-Social-Media-Rfp" target="_blank">Social Media Monitoring Solution</a>" being developed by the Federal Reserve will identify "<a title="key bloggers" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-reserve-plans-to-identify-key-bloggers-and-monitor-billions-of-conversations-about-the-fed-on-facebook-twitter-forums-and-blogs" target="_blank">key bloggers</a>" and monitor "<a title="billions of conversations" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66281284/Frbny-Social-Media-Rfp" target="_blank">billions of conversations</a>" about the Fed on Facebook, Twitter, forums and blogs.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> The U.S. government is ramping up efforts to have all of us watch one another and to report any sign of "suspicious activity" to them immediately.  But exactly what does "suspicious activity" entail?  According to a shocking document obtained by Oath Keepers, the FBI has really broadened their definition of "suspicious activity".  <a title="According to the document" href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/wp-content/uploads/ColoradoFBISurplusStore.pdf" target="_blank">According to the document</a>, "suspicious activity" now includes....</p>
<p>-paying with cash</p>
<p>-missing a hand or fingers</p>
<p>-"strange odors"</p>
<p>-making "extreme religious statements"</p>
<p>-"radical theology"</p>
<p>-purchasing weatherproofed ammunition or match containers</p>
<p>-purchasing meals ready to eat</p>
<p>-purchasing night vision devices, night flashlights or gas masks</p>
<p><a title="According to WorldNetDaily" href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=332925" target="_blank">According to WorldNetDaily</a>, this document is part of a "series of brochures" that will be distributed "to farm supply stores, gun shops, military surplus stores and even hotels and motels."</p>
<p>Our entire society is becoming extremely paranoid.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security is spending massive amounts of money and running tons of ads to promote the "<a href="http://www.dhs.gov/files/reportincidents/see-something-say-something.shtm">See Something, Say Something</a>" campaign.</p>
<p>Apparently the Obama administration wants to turn the entire country into a vast network of government snitches.</p>
<p>They spend billions upon billions of dollars watching all of us, and yet now they also want all of us to watch each other.</p>
<p>It is not right.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I don't want to end up living in a society that resembles the novel "1984" by George Orwell.</p>
<p>Sadly, the death of our civil liberties is very rarely mentioned by any of our politicians these days.</p>
<p>Both major political parties seem to have fully embraced the growing national security apparatus that is starting to suffocate the life out of this country.</p>
<p>Yes, we will always need security, but security measures should be implemented in such a way that they will never violate the liberty, freedom, honor or dignity of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>In a previous article, <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/enhanced-pat-downs-at-nfl-games-america-is-rapidly-turning-into-a-high-security-prison">I wrote the following</a>....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If those in charge of our security right now cannot protect us without compromising our liberty, freedom, honor and dignity then they need to immediately resign and allow someone else to do the job.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security should be given a dual mandate.  They must be charged with protecting us and they must be charged with protecting our liberty, freedom, honor and dignity at the same time.</p>
<p>If those running the security apparatus in this country right now feel like they cannot do that, then they need to step aside and let someone else take over.</p>
<p>The status quo is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Right now, all law enforcement personnel in this country are trained to bark at us like dogs and to treat us like cattle.</p>
<p>They are actually instructed to be mean and aggressive with us.  From the first day of training, they are taught to treat us like dirt.</p>
<p>Things were not always this way in America.  Once upon a time there was a clear distinction between the United States and "evil" totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>Well, today we are becoming a little more "evil" and a little more "totalitarian" with each passing day.</p>
<p>If you love liberty and freedom, you better watch your back.</p>
<p>America is changing, and not for the better.</p>

<p>The other day, this story about the new "<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66281284/Frbny-Social-Media-Rfp">Social Media Monitoring Solution</a>" that is being developed by the Federal Reserve was first broken by <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/here-comes-fiattackwatch-bernanke-goes-watergate-prepares-eavesdrop-everything-mentioning-fed">Zero Hedge</a>.  Then I wrote about this story on <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/">The Economic Collapse</a> and a lot of other bloggers started writing about it too.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that somebody must have hit a nerve or something. Just check out what CNBC had to say today....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Although the Fed claims its move into the social realm is so that it may better<strong><strong> <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/66281284/Frbny-Social-Media-Rfp" target="_blank">monitor its public perception</a></strong></strong>, some of the paranoids of the blogosphere are screaming Big Brother.</em></p>
<p><em>"Said otherwise, the Fed has just entered the counterespionage era and will be monitoring everything written about it anywhere in the world," Zero Hedge writes.</em></p>
<p><em>The <strong><strong><a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-reserve-plans-to-identify-key-bloggers-and-monitor-billions-of-conversations-about-the-fed-on-facebook-twitter-forums-and-blogs" target="_blank"><strong>Economic Collapse blog goes even further. </strong></a></strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em>In other words, the Federal Reserve wants to develop a highly sophisticated system that will gather everything that you and I say about the Federal Reserve on the Internet and that will analyze what our feelings about the Fed are. Obviously, any "positive" feelings about the Fed would not be a problem. What they really want to do is to gather information on everyone that views the Federal Reserve negatively. It is unclear how they plan to use this information once they have it, but considering how many alternative media sources have been shut down lately, this is obviously a very troubling sign.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So should I be honored that a CNBC story is quoting me or should I be horrified that they are calling me one of "the paranoids of the blogosphere"?</p>
<p>Look, it is not unusual for a large company to be involved in "data mining" operations.  Data mining has become a billion dollar business.</p>
<p>But for the Federal Reserve to be so paranoid that it feels like it must monitor everything that is being said about it on Facebook, Twitter, forums and blogs is more than a little creepy.</p>
<p>Is it really irrational to question why our "independent central bank" wants to spy on what we are saying online?</p>
<p>Look, nobody can stop the Federal Reserve from tracking what all of us are saying about it on the Internet.  It is perfectly legal for them to do.  But it definitely does smell like something that "Big Brother" would do.</p>
<p>If the Fed wanted to "poke" me on Facebook or send me a few "tweets" on Twitter that would be fine, but all of this "eye in the sky" stuff is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>Someone needs to tell the Federal Reserve that if it has a "public relations problem" it is not because of a few half-crazed bloggers.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans really did get upset when the giant financial bubbles caused by <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/19-reasons-why-the-federal-reserve-is-at-the-heart-of-our-economic-problems">reckless Fed policies</a> resulted in the largest financial calamity since the Great depression.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans really did get upset when Ben Bernanke promised us <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/is-ben-bernanke-a-liar-a-lunatic-or-is-he-just-completely-and-totally-incompetent">over and over and over</a> in 2005, 2006 and 2007 that everything was going to be okay and then the U.S. economy plunged into a horrific recession anyway.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans really did get upset when they learned that the Fed made trillions of dollars of <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-looting-of-america-the-federal-reserve-made-16-trillion-in-secret-loans-to-their-bankster-friends-and-the-media-is-ignoring-the-eye-popping-corruption-that-has-been-uncovered">secret loans</a> to their friends during the last financial crisis.</p>
<p>The truth is that the Federal Reserve system is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>It is a perpetual debt machine that was designed to enslave the United States government to a mountain of debt that never stops expanding.</p>
<p>Right now, the U.S. national debt is more than <a title="4700 times larger" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo3.htm" target="_blank">4700 times larger</a> than it was when the Federal Reserve was created back in 1913.</p>
<p>So should we be thankful to the Fed for that?</p>
<p>But instead of engaging us in rational debate, the Fed apparently wants to chill our free speech by letting us know that we are being watched.</p>
<p>This is part of a disturbing trend that is rapidly growing in America.  Those in power want us to know that they are watching us so that we will not be so eager to speak out.</p>
<p>For example, a new website known as "<a title="Attack Watch" href="http://www.attackwatch.com/" target="_blank">Attack Watch</a>" has been launched that will be gathering information on those that say "negative" things about Barack Obama on the Internet.</p>
<p>But sadly, it is not just those in power that are seeking to chill free speech.  Right now we are a nation that is <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/divide-and-conquer-are-the-left-and-the-right-in-america-about-to-go-to-war-with-each-other">deeply divided</a>.  Everywhere you look, someone is engaged in political intimidation.  Some of the things that liberals say that they want to do to Tea Party activists are obscene enough to make a sailor blush.  Some conservatives say hateful things about Barack Obama and other top Democrats that are absolutely embarrassing.</p>
<p>Every single day "liberal" news outlets feed into the hatred that liberals have for conservatives, and every single day "conservative" news outlets feed into the hatred that conservatives have for liberals.</p>
<p>And if you think things are bad right now, just wait until we get closer to the 2012 election.  The hatred is going to grow to levels that we have never even seen before.</p>
<p>But this is the way that the elite like it.  They like us frothing at the mouth and totally engaged in the false left/right paradigm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our real problems go unsolved and the elite continue to strengthen their hold on this country.</p>
<p>Please wake up.  There are only minor differences between most Democrats and most Republicans.  Nearly every single one of them deserves to be voted out of office.</p>
<p>We need to speak up even louder and let the American people know that there are other choices.</p>
<p>They don't have to be stuck with having to choose between the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>All across America, millions of Americans are waking up to the reality that neither political party plans to balance the budget, neither political party plans to restore our civil liberties and neither political party plans to shut down the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>We need fundamental political and economic change in America, and we are not going to get that from either the Republicans or the Democrats.</p>
<p>We desperately need for this country to fall in love with the U.S. Constitution again and to return this nation to the principles that is was founded upon.</p>
<p>That is not going to happen under Barack Obama, it is not going to happen under <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/14-reasons-why-rick-perry-would-be-a-really-really-bad-president">Rick Perry</a>, it is not going to happen under Mitt Romney and it is not going to happen as long as the Federal Reserve is running our economy.</p>
<p>America is literally being run into the ground by "establishment Democrats", by "establishment Republicans" and by the Federal Reserve.  Our current leadership has us on a path that will only lead to disaster.</p>
<p>Is this really the way that our story is going to end?</p>
<p>Or is America going to wake up and demand something better?</p>
<p>It is up to you America.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842305351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shatteparadi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0842305351"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1622" title="18 Examples Of How Christians Are Being Specifically Targeted By Big Brother" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/18-Examples-Of-How-Christians-Are-Being-Specifically-Targeted-By-Big-Brother-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>When the freedom of speech of one group is being threatened, it is a threat to all of us.  Just because you may not be a Christian, don't think that what you are about to read is not a problem for you as well.  The truth is that any individual or group that does not "fit in" with the new "politically-correct" global system that is emerging is going to be persecuted sooner or later.  In our society today, it has become quite fashionable to bash Christians.  In fact, I am quite certain that some of the comments that get left after this article will say really horrible things about Christians.  But after "Big Brother" is done with the Christians, are you sure that they will not come after you next?  When I speak of "Big Brother", I am not just speaking of the government.  In today's world, giant corporations and the mainstream media also play instrumental roles in the totalitarian police state prison grid that is being constructed all around us.  The elite control the government, they run nearly all of the major corporations and they own most of the major media outlets.  Anyone that does not "conform" to their system is a threat.  As time goes by, the persecution of those that attempt to "rebel" against their system is only going to become more intense.</p>
<p>So if you are not a Christian, do not applaud when the system cracks down on Bible-believing Christians.</p>
<p>You never know, you might be next.</p>
<p>The following are 18 examples of how Christians are being specifically targeted by "Big Brother"....</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> Home Bible studies <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/calif-couple-says-city-officials-targeting-christian-gatherings-56554/">are now banned</a> in the city of San Juan Capistrano, California.  According to city officials, regular gatherings "<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/calif-couple-will-face-further-500-fines-if-ignore-home-bible-study-ban-56253/">of more than three people</a>" in private homes are simply not allowed.  One couple that has held home Bible studies for years has already <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/calif-couple-says-city-officials-targeting-christian-gatherings-56554/">been fined twice</a> and is being threatened with even more fines.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> Paypal has initiated "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=345613">formal investigations</a>" of a large number of Christian websites and organizations.  Apparently, many of these investigations have been launched due to concerns that these websites and organizations do not hold to a "politically-correct" view of sexuality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=345613">According to WorldNetDaily</a>, Paypal has targeted include <a href="http://americansfortruth.com/">Americans For Truth</a>, <a href="http://www.lastdayswatchman.blogspot.com/">Last Days Watchman</a> and a host of other Christian organizations including "Abiding Truth Ministries, New Generation Ministries, Noua Dreapta of Romania, Truth in Action Ministries, Dove World Outreach, Faith Word Baptist Church, Family Research Institute and American Society for the Defense of Traditional Family".</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> In Wichita, Kansas last year, a Christian minister <a href="http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.7306/pub_detail.asp">was handcuffed and hauled off to jail by police</a> for sharing the gospel and handing out tracts to Muslims on a public sidewalk.  Apparently freedom of speech does not apply on the public sidewalks of America any longer.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> In the UK, police recently threatened a cafe owner with arrest for silently playing a Bible DVD on a small television on the back wall of his cafe.  The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2041504/Police-tell-cafe-owner-Stop-showing-Bible-DVDs-arrest-you.html">a Daily Mail article</a> about this incident....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Mr Murray, 31, was left shocked after he was questioned for nearly an hour by the officers, who arrived unannounced at the premises.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>He said he had turned off the Bible DVD after an ‘aggressive inquisition’ during which he thought he was going to be arrested and ‘frog-marched out of the cafe like a criminal’. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#5</strong> Last year, a high school student in Southern California <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-student-suspended-for-sharing-faith-sues-school-district-49655/">was suspended for two days</a> because he had private conversations with his classmates during which he discussed Christianity.  He was also banned from bringing his Bible to school ever again.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> Big cable networks regularly feature "comedians" that love to mock Christians.  For example, HBO "comedian" Bill Maher recently stated that "<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2011/09/17/maher_christians_are_people_who_hate_charity_and_love_killing.html">there's a term for people who hate charity and love killing: Christian</a>".</p>
<p>If that had been said about another minority group, it would have made front page headlines for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> Down in Texas, the Department of Veteran Affairs actually tried to ban prayers <a href="http://www.ktrh.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=121300&amp;article=8770750">that include the words "God" or "Jesus"</a> during funeral services for veterans.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> In North Carolina last year, a pastor <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/20100711/jesus-prayer-pastor-demands-apology-from-nc-lawmakers/index.html" target="_blank">was dismissed from his chaplain duties</a> for praying in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> An unclassified Department of Homeland Security report published a couple years ago entitled "<a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf">Right-wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment</a>" claims that a belief in Bible prophecy "could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons."  The report goes on to state that such people are potentially dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> Back on February 20, 2009, the State of Missouri issued a report entitled "<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/13290698/The-Modern-Militia-MovementMissouri-MIAC-Strategic-Report-20Feb09-">MIAC Strategic Report: The Modern Militia Movement</a>".  That report warned that the following types of people may be potential terrorists....</p>
<p>*anti-abortion activists</p>
<p>*those that are against illegal immigration</p>
<p>*those that consider "the New World Order" to be a threat</p>
<p>*those that have a negative view of the United Nations</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> All over the nation, "child protection agencies" are ripping an inordinate number of children <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/07/homeschool-anti-vaccine-family-being.html">out of Christian homes</a>.  In many of these cases the parents believe in homeschooling their children or they do not believe in having their children vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> On June 18, 2010 two Christians decided that they would peacefully pass out copies of the gospel of John on a public sidewalk outside a public Islamic festival in Dearborn, Michigan and <a title="within three minutes" href="../archives/freedom-of-speech-is-dead">within three minutes</a> 8 police officers surrounded them and placed them under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> A Christian consultant <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-consultant-fired-by-bank-of-america-over-gay-marriage-book-55047/">was recently fired</a> by Bank of America and by Cisco because they discovered a book that he had written that expressed Christian viewpoints about social issues.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> A while back, a federal judge actually ruled that the University of California <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/13/BAQT129NMG.DTL&amp;hw=creationism&amp;sn=005&amp;sc=646">can deny course credit</a> to applicants from Christian high schools that use textbooks that teach that it was God who created the earth.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> Back in 2009, one 8 year old boy in Massachusetts was sent home from school <a title="and was forced to undergo a psychological evaluation" href="http://www.tauntongazette.com/news/x1903566059/Taunton-second-grader-suspended-over-drawing-of-Jesus" target="_blank">and was forced to undergo a psychological evaluation</a> because he drew a picture of Jesus on the cross.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> The Obama administration has announced that there is a whole host of laws that it will not be enforcing, but one thing that the Obama administration has chosen to do is to <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20110504/D9N0U3JO1.html">aggressively pursue lawsuits</a> against anti-abortion protesters.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> <a title="during a recent Congressional hearing" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBAmPxSI8bo&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">During a Congressional hearing earlier this year</a>, U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee warned that "Christian militants" might try to "bring down the country" and that such groups need to be investigated.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> According to a shocking FBI document obtained by Oath Keepers, the FBI definition of "suspicious activity" now includes making "<a title="extreme religious statements" href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/wp-content/uploads/ColoradoFBISurplusStore.pdf" target="_blank">extreme religious statements</a>" and believing in "<a title="radical theology" href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/wp-content/uploads/ColoradoFBISurplusStore.pdf" target="_blank">radical theology</a>".</p>
<p>The good news is that there still is at least a limited amount of religious freedom in America.  It may soon be gone, but at least we are in better shape than most of the globe.</p>
<p>Almost 70 percent of the population of the world now lives in countries where religious activities <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/two-thirds-of-global-population-live-in-religiously-restrictive-countries-42314/">are highly restricted</a>.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that the entire planet is moving away from freedom of religion.</p>
<p>That is a right that we are supposed to be guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution, but it should be obvious to everyone that our right to religious freedom is rapidly dying.</p>
<p>If you are not religious, don't think that you should not be fighting for religious freedom along with the rest of us.</p>
<p>Once they take some of our rights away, it will be much easier for them to take all the rest of our rights away.</p>
<p>United we stand, or divided we will fall.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029BE7AW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shatteparadi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0029BE7AW"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1619" title="The Mad As Hell Generation 20 Reasons Why Millions Of Americans Under 30 Are Giving Up On The US Economy" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The-Mad-As-Hell-Generation-20-Reasons-Why-Millions-Of-Americans-Under-30-Are-Giving-Up-On-The-US-Economy-250x165.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="165" /></a>Millions upon millions of young Americans have completely lost faith in the U.S. economy and are mad as hell that their economic futures have been destroyed.  The recent economic downturn has hit those under the age of 30 the hardest.  Today, there are hordes of young people that should be entering their most productive years that are sitting home with nothing to do.  Many of them have worked incredibly hard throughout high school and college.  Many of them have stayed out of trouble and have done everything that "the system" asked them to do.  But once they got finished with school, the promised "rewards" simply were not there.  Instead, millions of young Americans are faced with crushing student loan debt loads in an economy where they can't find good jobs.  When you are in your twenties, it can be absolutely soul-crushing to send out hundreds (or even thousands) of resumes and not get a single interview.  Most of us grew up believing that we would "be something" when we got older, and millions of young Americans are having those dreams brutally crushed right now.  Americans under the age of 30 voted for Barack Obama in droves back in 2008 because they believed that he would make things better.  Instead, Barack Obama has made things even worse.  Significant numbers of young Americans are starting to wake up and realize that neither political party is providing any real answers, and they are starting to get mad as hell about it.</p>
<p>Americans under the age of 30 don't want to hear that they are not going to be able to do better than their parents.  They don't want to hear that they are going to have to "pay the price" because of the mistakes of previous generations.  They don't want to hear that the "good jobs" that have been held out as a "carrot" for them all these years have disappeared and are not coming back.</p>
<p>Millions of young Americans want what was promised to them.  They want good jobs that will enable them to enjoy the "American Dream".  They want things to go back to the way that things used to work in America.</p>
<p>If you spend much time around those in their twenties, you know that many of them have a look of hopelessness in their eyes.  Large numbers of them have moved back in with their parents.  Large numbers of them are flipping burgers or working retail jobs part-time because that is all they can find.  There are even a growing number of them that have given up entirely and have completely checked out.</p>
<p>So are we in the process of creating a "lost generation"?</p>
<p>The following are 20 reasons why millions of Americans under the age of 30 are giving up on the U.S. economy....</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> Only <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CENSUS_RECESSIONS_IMPACT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2011-09-22-00-17-27">55.3%</a> of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 were employed last year.  That was the lowest level that we have seen since World War II.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> Today, there are <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CENSUS_RECESSIONS_IMPACT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2011-09-22-00-17-27">5.9 million</a> Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 that are living with their parents.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The economic downturn has been particularly tough on men.  According to Census data, men are <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CENSUS_RECESSIONS_IMPACT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2011-09-22-00-17-27">twice as likely</a> to live with their parents as women are.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> Amazingly, <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/lawless-america-20-examples-of-desperate-people-doing-desperate-things">less than 30 percent</a> of all U.S. teens had a job this summer.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> Approximately <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CENSUS_RECESSIONS_IMPACT?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2011-09-22-00-17-27">one out of every five</a> Americans under the age of 30 is currently living in poverty.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> According to one recent survey, only <a title="14 percent" href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/09/07/most-20-somethings-are-pessimistic-about-their-financial-futures/" target="_blank">14 percent</a> of all Americans that are 28 or 29 years old are optimistic about their financial futures.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> Since the year 2000, incomes for U.S. households led by someone between the ages of 25 and 34 have fallen <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/every-age-group-is-getting-poorer-in-america-except-for-one-2011-9">by about 12 percent</a> after you adjust for inflation.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> The cost of "getting an education" has become increasingly burdensome in recent years.  Average yearly tuition at U.S. private universities is now up <a title="to $27,293" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpZtX32sKVE" target="_blank">to $27,293</a>.  That figure has increased by 29% in just the past five years.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> In America today, <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/student-loan-debt-hell-21-statistics-that-will-make-you-think-twice-about-going-to-college">approximately two-thirds</a> of all college students graduate with student loans.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> Millions of young Americans are absolutely being financially strangled by horrific student loan debt loads.  Sadly, the total amount of student loan debt in the United States <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/is-college-worth-it">now exceeds</a> the total amount of credit card debt in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> In 2010, the average college graduate had accumulated <a title="approximately $25,000" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/26/college-graduates-debt_n_854047.html" target="_blank">approximately $25,000</a> in student loan debt by graduation day.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> <a title="One-third of all college graduates" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hey-college-seniors-this-is-whats-happening-to-your-peers-when-they-try-to-find-jobs-2011-4#for-many-of-you-your-degrees-wont-matter-one-third-of-you-will-land-full-time-jobs-that-dont-require-them-5" target="_blank">One-third of all college graduates</a> end up taking jobs that don't even require college degrees.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> In the United States today, there are <a title="more than 100,000" href="http://growth.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/26-04-11%20Middle%20Class%20Under%20Stress.pdf" target="_blank">more than 100,000</a> janitors that have college degrees.</p>
<p><strong>#14</strong> In the United States today, <a title="317,000 waiters and waitresses" href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/why-did-17-million-students-go-to-college/27634" target="_blank">317,000 waiters and waitresses</a> have college degrees.</p>
<p><strong>#15</strong> In the United States today, approximately <a title="365,000 cashiers" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/need-a-job-too-bad-the-good-jobs-are-being-shipped-out-of-america-as-part-of-the-new-one-world-economy" target="_blank">365,000 cashiers</a> have college degrees.</p>
<p><strong>#16</strong> In the United States today, <a title="24.5 percent" href="http://collegeaffordability.blogspot.com/2010/10/underemployed-college-graduate.html" target="_blank">24.5 percent</a> of all retail salespersons have a college degree.</p>
<p><strong>#17</strong> As the economy has crumbled, fewer young Americans have been getting married.  Today, an all-time low <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/america-lost-generation-census-2011-9">44.2%</a> of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are married.</p>
<p><strong>#18</strong> Young Americans are becoming increasingly frustrated as our politicians stand by and do nothing while our economy is being <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/new-world-trade-center-tower-to-be-made-with-glass-from-china-and-steel-from-germany">hollowed out</a>.  The sad truth is that United States has lost an average of 50,000 <a title="manufacturing jobs" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/how-can-america-create-wealth-if-our-industrial-base-is-destroyed-50000-manufacturing-jobs-have-been-lost-every-month-since-2001" target="_blank">manufacturing jobs</a> a month since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and top politicians in both major political parties keep pushing for even more job-killing "free trade" agreements.</p>
<p><strong>#19</strong> Young Americans are becoming increasingly frustrated that pretty much the only jobs that seem to be available are low paying jobs.  Back in 1980, <a title="less than 30%" href="http://growth.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/26-04-11%20Middle%20Class%20Under%20Stress.pdf" target="_blank">less than 30%</a> of all jobs in the United States were low income jobs.  Today, <a title="more than 40%" href="http://growth.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/26-04-11%20Middle%20Class%20Under%20Stress.pdf" target="_blank">more than 40%</a> of all jobs in the United States are low income jobs.</p>
<p><strong>#20</strong> Young Americans are becoming increasingly frustrated that previous generations have saddled them with a 14 trillion dollar <a title="national debt" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/national-debt">national debt</a> that they are expected to make payments on for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>A lot of young Americans swing back and forth between anger and despair.  Many of them worked like crazy for years because of the promise of a better life, and now they are being bitterly disappointed.  Just consider the following testimonial that was recently posted <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/jobless-in-america-an-anthology-of-testimonials-about-unemployment/245182/2/">on The Atlantic</a>....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I am in my mid-20s. I have a university education. I started working when I was 14. I have chemical burns and scars over my hands from dealing with caustic cleaning chemicals. I did not want that to be my life like my uncles. I had to get out. I worked very hard in high school and volunteered and was the member of clubs and all of that great stuff. I got into a good university and worked hard. I took a language course, took things that I loved. I worked through my degree - I was even a janitor in a building that I lived in, because I needed the cut in rent. I did that for no pay.</em></p>
<p><em>After these months of unemployment I have fallen into a pretty major depression. I live at home, I do chores, I look for work. As much as I want to get my life together, I have some great mental health issues to deal with - but have neither the money to purchase medication that may help me, nor the ability to pay for psychological or psychiatric help.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So what can be done?</p>
<p>Well, someone could wave a magic wand and fix the U.S. economy, but we all know that is not going to happen.</p>
<p>In fact, there is all kinds of evidence that the U.S. economy <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/30-signs-that-the-u-s-economy-is-about-to-go-into-the-toilet">is about to get even worse</a>.</p>
<p>So should we just tell our young people that they might as well just give up and start making rap videos about using food stamp cards like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylV8y_JZbuk">this one</a>?  (*Warning* The video contains some very strong language.)</p>
<p>The number of Americans on food stamps has increased by 74 percent since 2007.  Millions of young people are learning that the only way to survive is to be dependent on the government.</p>
<p>It certainly does not help that our entire education system is deeply broken.  For example, did you know that the verbal scores on the SAT for the class of 2011 were <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/education/9008-sat-scores-hit-rock-bottom">the lowest ever recorded</a>?</p>
<p>Our students have become so "dumbed down" that large numbers of them can barely even function in society once they graduate.</p>
<p>That is not their fault.</p>
<p>That is our fault.</p>
<p>We have failed young Americans in so many ways that it would take a series of books to detail them all.</p>
<p>We can say that we are sorry, but that just isn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>Millions of young Americans want what was promised to them, but we no longer have it to give to them.</p>
<p>Anger in this nation is already starting to boil over <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/lawless-america-20-examples-of-desperate-people-doing-desperate-things">in strange and unpredictable ways</a>.  If the economy gets even worse, we are going to have tens of millions of young Americans that are mad as hell and that are ready to riot in the streets.</p>
<p>What are we going to do then?</p>
<p>According to a recent Gallup poll, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/149678/Americans-Express-Historic-Negativity-Toward-Government.aspx">81 percent</a> of Americans are "dissatisfied with the way the nation is being governed".</p>
<p>That is not a sign of a healthy nation.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that the foundations of America are crumbling and we have millions upon millions of young people that are incredibly angry and incredibly frustrated.</p>
<p>It does not take a genius to figure out that is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>So please pray for America.</p>
<p>We are going to need it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dawnoftheweak.com/2011/09/fox-news-google-debate-9222011.html">According to blogger Wes Hemings</a>, the following is how much talking time each candidate received during the last Republican debate....</p>
<p>Romney 12:09<br />
Perry 11:10<br />
Huntsman 7:41<br />
Santorum 7:06<br />
Cain 6:23<br />
Bachmann 6:13<br />
Gingrich 5:44<br />
Ron Paul 4:33<br />
Johnson 4:10</p>
<p>So was it just Fox News that was so slanted?</p>
<p>What has happened at other recent Republican debates?</p>
<p>Well, Hemmings <a href="http://www.dawnoftheweak.com/2011/09/cnn-teaparty-debate-9122011-statistics.html">also analyzed</a> the distribution of talking time during the recent Republican debate on CNN....</p>
<p>Perry  13:54<br />
Romney  10:56<br />
Ron Paul  7:34<br />
Bachmann  8:35<br />
Newt  7:32<br />
Cain  5:42<br />
Santorum  7:06<br />
Huntsman  7:50</p>
<p>Wow - that debate certainly did not seem fair either.</p>
<p>Hemmings also broke down the talking time allotted to each candidate <a href="http://www.dawnoftheweak.com/2011/09/msnbcpolitico-9-7-2011-debate.html">during the recent MSNBC debate</a>....</p>
<p>Perry 14:59<br />
Mitt 11:57<br />
Paul 9:19<br />
Bachmann 9:05<br />
Newt 6:53<br />
Herman 5:41<br />
Santorum 6:11<br />
Huntsman 8:52</p>
<p>In all three debates, Rick Perry and Mitt Romney received far more talking time than any of the other candidates.  They are always positioned at center stage and the attention never stays away from those two for very long.</p>
<p>These debates reinforce the perception that none of the other candidates even has a chance.  For example, a recent USA Today article entitled "<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-09-25/GOP-presidential-race-Romney-Perry-debates/50547872/1">GOP debates signal a race between Romney and Perry</a>" made the following statement....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The debates have bolstered what most polls of the Republican race have shown; it's a two-man race between Perry and Romney.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>All of the major news networks spend far more time talking about Perry and Romney than they do about the other candidates.  Then during the debates, Perry and Romney receive far more talking time than the other candidates do.  Then after the debates, most of the talking heads spend most of their time talking about how Perry and Romney did (even if their instant online polls show that one of the other candidates won the debate).</p>
<p>There is something fundamentally un-American about what has been going on in these debates.  How is our choice of candidates supposed to be legitimate when two candidates keep getting pushed to the front?</p>
<p>Another thing that the numbers above reveal is a significant bias in favor of "establishment candidates" on the part of those running the debates.</p>
<p>Okay, if they want to give Perry and Romney extra time because they are leading in the polls, then why don't those rules apply to all the other candidates?  For example, Jon Huntsman (an establishment candidate) has been <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html">averaging 1.2% support</a> in recent polls.  Yet Huntsman received more talking time than any of the other "second tier" candidates in the last debate.  In fact, he received more than 50% more talking time than some of them.</p>
<p>If polls are going to mean so much during these debates, then it is not just Perry and Romney that should benefit.  For example, during the recent debate on Fox News, the first question went to Rick Perry (1st in the polls at the time), the second question went to Mitt Romney (2nd in the polls at the time), and then the candidate that was running third in the polls at the time (Ron Paul) was completely skipped over.  In fact, they didn't come back to him until well into the debate.</p>
<p>Herman Cain is currently getting more than 4 times the support in the polls that Jon Huntsman is getting, and yet Huntsman has been given significantly more talking time during each of the recent Republican debates.</p>
<p>So why is Huntsman getting so much talking time?</p>
<p>He barely even registers in the polls.</p>
<p>What in the world is going on?</p>
<p>It seems as though there is a less than subtle attempt by the mainstream media to feature establishment candidates such as <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/14-reasons-why-rick-perry-would-be-a-really-really-bad-president">Rick Perry</a>, Mitt Romney and John Huntsman.  But if any of them is actually elected, things will continue to run pretty much the same way that they did under Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>No matter who we seem to elect, not much seems to change.  We could really use some fresh thinking in the White House, and yet the mainstream media continues to push establishment candidates into our faces.</p>
<p>The favoritism for Rick Perry and Mitt Romney has become so obvious that even Saturday Night Live is making jokes about the fact that none of the other candidates seem to have a shot at winning.  You can see video of the Saturday Night Live spoof of the recent Republican debates <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snl-skewers-the-gop-presidential-candidates-2011-9">right here</a>.</p>
<p>No real votes are going to be cast for Republican candidates until next February.  What would be the harm in giving each of the candidates an equal number of questions and a roughly equal amount of time to express their views?</p>
<p>I was deeply insulted by how Fox News, CNN and MSNBC handled the recent debates.  It should be obvious to any thinking human being that Perry and Romney are being favored.  Republican voters are being highly manipulated and it is disgusting.</p>
<p>How is it fair that Mitt Romney got 18.65% of the talking time in the last debate but Michele Bachmann only got only 9.54% of the talking time?</p>
<p>How is it fair that Rick Perry got 17.14% of the talking time in the last debate but Herman Cain only got 9.80% of the talking time?</p>
<p>How is it fair that Jon Huntsman got 11.79% of the talking time in the last debate but Ron Paul only got 6.98% of the talking time?</p>
<p>Even if you support Perry, Romney or Huntsman, you should still be in favor of fair and balanced debates.</p>
<p>Right now, the Republican Party is losing credibility because of these debates, the mainstream news media is losing credibility because of these debates and our entire political process is losing credibility because of these debates.</p>
<p>Is there anyone out there that is able to defend the shameful favoritism that is going on?</p>
<p>If so, please step up to the plate.</p>
<p>In fact, if anyone out there would like to share their thoughts on the recent Republican debates, please feel free to leave a comment below....</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=shatteparadi-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1612" title="Freedom Tower by Eden, Janine and Jim on Flickr" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Freedom-Tower-by-Eden-Janine-and-Jim-on-Flickr-187x250.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="250" /></a>Did you know that the new World Trade Center tower is being constructed with glass from China and steel from Germany?  1 World Trade Center, also known as "The Freedom Tower", is not just another skyscraper.  It is essentially a national monument.  But that doesn't mean that we are above awarding construction contracts to the lowest bidder.  The new World Trade Center tower will contain <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/9/9/rebuilt_ground_zero_billed_as_national">250 tons</a> of steel from Germany and the lower floors will be surrounded <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/business/19glass.html">with blast-resistant glass from China</a>.  This is yet another example of how the U.S. economy is being hollowed out.  Once upon a time, the United States produced more steel and glass than anyone else in the world.  But now we are being deindustrialized at a blinding pace.  We have lost tens of thousands of factories and millions of jobs over the past decade.  We are going to have a trade imbalance of about a half a trillion dollars this year.  Meanwhile, our federal, state and local governments are going into massive amounts of debt in order to keep funding government activities at a level that our hollowed out economy simply cannot support any longer.</p>
<p>Did you also know that the new MLK memorial on the National Mall <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8715823/Martin-Luther-King-memorial-made-in-China.html">was also made in China</a>?</p>
<p>Yet there was very little uproar about that in the mainstream media.  A few activists out there made some waves, but generally people do not seem troubled by this.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from a report about the new MLK memorial <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8715823/Martin-Luther-King-memorial-made-in-China.html">in The Telegraph</a>....</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p><em>However, there has been controversy over the choice of Lei Yixin, a 57-year-old master sculptor from Changsha in Hunan province, to carry out the work. Critics have openly asked why a black, or at least an American, artist was not chosen and even remarked that Dr King appears slightly Asian in Mr Lei's rendering.</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p><em>Mr Lei, who has in the past carved two statues of Mao Tse-tung, one of which stands in the former garden of Mao Anqing, the Chinese leader's son, carried out almost all of the work in Changsha.</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<blockquote><p><em>More than 150 granite blocks, weighing some 1,600 tons, were then shipped from Xiamen to the port of Baltimore, and reassembled by a team of 100 workmen, including ten Chinese stone masons brought over specifically for the project.</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Well, if you don't care about where our national symbols are made, you should at least care about the millions of jobs that we have been losing.</p>
<p>Since 1975, the United States had run a total trade deficit <a title="of 7.5 trillion dollars" href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/gands.pdf" target="_blank">of more than 7.5 trillion dollars</a> with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>All of that money could have gone to U.S. businesses and U.S. workers.  In turn, those businesses and workers would have paid taxes on all of that wealth.</p>
<p>But instead, all of that wealth went out of the United States.</p>
<p>The proponents of the theory of "comparative advantage" tell us that each country should focus on the things that they are most efficient at making, and then they should all trade with each other.</p>
<p>Well, when we merged our economy with the economies of nations where it is legal to pay slave labor wages, suddenly we made it more "efficient" for big corporations to make almost everything overseas.</p>
<p>The more we have "liberalized" our trade, the faster we have lost jobs.</p>
<p>The American people need to learn the facts.  The United States has lost <a title="a&amp;nbsp;staggering 32 percent" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_plight_of_american_manufacturing" target="_blank">a staggering 32 percent</a> of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000, and <a title="over 42,000" href="../archives/globalist-shill-barack-obama-asks-business-leaders-for-job-creation-ideas-even-as-he-ships-more-of-our-jobs-overseas-as-part-of-the-new-one-world-economy" target="_blank">over 42,000</a> manufacturing facilities in the United States have been closed down since 2001.</p>
<p><a title="Between December 2000 and December 2010" href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=267889" target="_blank">Between December 2000 and December 2010</a>, 38 percent of the manufacturing jobs in Ohio were lost, 42 percent of the manufacturing jobs in North Carolina were lost and 48 percent of the manufacturing jobs in Michigan were lost.</p>
<p>Thank you George W. Bush and Barack Obama for such a wonderful economic miracle!</p>
<p>If we allow corporations to make stuff in countries where they can legally pay slave labor wages and then ship those products into the United States for free, we should not be surprised when we lose millions of jobs.</p>
<p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out why there are fewer jobs in this country than there used to be.</p>
<p>Right now, if you gathered together all of the people that are "officially" unemployed in the United States, they would constitute <a title="the 68th largest country in the world" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/wake-up-america-10-very-obvious-reasons-why-the-devastating-u-s-jobs-famine-is-going-to-suck-the-hope-right-out-of-america" target="_blank">the 68th largest country in the world</a>.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>But all of this "free trade" is also dramatically driving down wages for the people that still do have jobs.</p>
<p>According to one study, between 1969 and 2009 the median wages earned by American men between the ages of 30 and 50 dropped <a title="by 27 percent" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/print/2011-08-25/obama-seeks-jobs-plan-as-u-s-workingman-status-further-erodes.html" target="_blank">by 27 percent</a> after you account for inflation.</p>
<p>You see, the truth is that "free trade" slowly but surely pushes down the standard of living of America workers.  If American workers have to directly compete for jobs against people making a dollar an hour on the other side of the globe, it is inevitable that their salaries and benefits are going to shrink.</p>
<p>In addition to slave labor wages overseas, <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/giant-sucking-sound-part-2-the-nafta-of-the-pacific-will-soon-allow-millions-more-american-jobs-to-be-shipped-overseas">in a previous article</a> I discussed a number of the other factors that are causing jobs to pour out of this country at a staggering pace....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>*Many foreign nations deeply and directly subsidize national industries and the U.S. government lets them get away with it.  That puts our industries at a vast disadvantage.</em></p>
<p><em>*The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.  That puts our corporations at a vast disadvantage.</em></p>
<p><em>*Many foreign nations do not require businesses to provide health care for their employees.  That puts our businesses at a vast disadvantage.</em></p>
<p><em>*Many foreign nations impose very little regulation on businesses.  That puts businesses in the United States at a vast disadvantage.  In the U.S., we have some of the most restrictive regulations in the world.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, the United States is bleeding massive amounts of national wealth every single month.</p>
<p>In other words, we are getting <strong>poorer</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, the United States spends <a title="more than 4 dollars" href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/ft900.pdf" target="_blank">more than 4 dollars</a> on goods and services from China for every one dollar that China spends on goods and services from the United States.</p>
<p>Does that seem like "fair and balanced" trade to you?</p>
<p>The U.S. trade deficit with China in 2010 <a title="was 27 times larger" href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html" target="_blank">was 27 times larger</a> than it was back in 1990.</p>
<p>That trend sure is not heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>China is rising and we are falling.</p>
<p>For example, did you know that the United States has lost an average of 50,000 <a title="manufacturing jobs" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/how-can-america-create-wealth-if-our-industrial-base-is-destroyed-50000-manufacturing-jobs-have-been-lost-every-month-since-2001" target="_blank">manufacturing jobs</a> <em>per month</em> since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001?</p>
<p>Did you know that China is now <a href="http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/china-passes-us-largest-pc-market">the largest PC market</a> in the entire world?</p>
<p>In <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/america-is-rotting-while-china-is-rising">a previous article</a>, I mentioned some of the stunning new investments that U.S. corporations are making in China....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>*Coca-Cola is opening up <a title="three new factories" href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/news/economy/1108/gallery.china_jobs_american_companies/?iid=HP_River" target="_blank">three new factories</a> in China this year.</em></p>
<p><em>*Disney recently broke ground on a <a title="$4.4 billion project" href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/news/economy/1108/gallery.china_jobs_american_companies/2.html" target="_blank">$4.4 billion project</a> that will be known as Shanghai Disneyland.</em></p>
<p><em>*Procter &amp; Gamble has invested <a title="over a billion dollars" href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/news/economy/1108/gallery.china_jobs_american_companies/3.html" target="_blank">over a billion dollars</a> in operations in China.</em></p>
<p><em>*Caterpillar has built <a title="16 factories" href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/news/economy/1108/gallery.china_jobs_american_companies/4.html" target="_blank">16 factories</a> in China and now employs more than 8,000 workers there.</em></p>
<p><em>*<a title="Ford" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-07/28/content_12997526.htm" target="_blank">Ford</a> is currently "building three factories in Chongqing as part of $1.6 billion investment that also includes another plant in Nanchang".</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The reality is that <a title="Globalism" href="../archives/how-globalism-has-destroyed-our-jobs-businesses-and-national-wealth-in-10-easy-steps" target="_blank">globalism</a> is absolutely destroying our economy.  Other countries are not playing fair with us, and the loss of jobs and factories is rapidly hollowing out our economic system.</p>
<p>But will you hear any of the candidates talk about this during the Republican debate tonight?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>And Obama is <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/giant-sucking-sound-part-2-the-nafta-of-the-pacific-will-soon-allow-millions-more-american-jobs-to-be-shipped-overseas">busy pushing</a> for even more "free trade" agreements.</p>
<p>Both major political parties continue to insist that what we need is even more "free trade".</p>
<p>So we are going to lose even more jobs, even more manufacturing capacity, even more wealth and even more of our formerly great industrial cities are going to end up degenerating into <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/american-hellholes">hellholes</a>.</p>
<p>This is an issue that conservatives, liberals and libertarians should all be able to agree on.</p>
<p>Other countries are cheating us blind, we are losing millions of good jobs and we have surrendered massive amounts of national sovereignty to organizations such as the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>The people of the United States need to make the deindustrialization of America a major issue during the 2012 campaign season.</p>
<p>Our economy is getting hollowed out a little bit more every single day.</p>
<p>Please act now while there is still something left to save.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S7SUDK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shatteparadi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004S7SUDK"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1609" title="football" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/football-250x188.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="188" /></a>Government in America has gotten completely and totally out of control.  Our founding fathers originally intended to set up a nation where the power of government would be greatly limited, but today government has become a horribly bloated monster that is relentlessly growing.  It is not just the federal government that I am talking about.  All over the country, there are state and local governments that have become monstrous as well.  No matter who we elect, they just want even more of our money, they demand even more of our time and our resources, they pile even more rules and regulations on to our backs, they seek even more control over us and our children and they take even more of our liberties and freedoms away.  They have invented hundreds of different ways to drain money out of us, and yet it is never enough.  They pile up nightmarish debts that they expect our children and our grandchildren to repay, and yet our cities and our infrastructure are crumbling all around us.  Government seems to have a relentless appetite for demanding even more from all of us, and yet they seem to badly mess up everything that they try to accomplish.  Well, I have a message for the government.  Get off our backs!</p>
<p>I was horrified recently when I learned that the state of Virginia plans <a href="http://wtop.com/?nid=41&amp;sid=2552332">to put toll booths</a> on Interstate 95.</p>
<p>Talk about a stupid idea!</p>
<p>I used to spend many hours traveling up and down Interstate 95.  It is a traffic nightmare and the last thing anyone needs is for it to become even more congested.</p>
<p>But that is what is going to happen.</p>
<p>So why are they doing this?</p>
<p>Well, it is another way for them to make money.</p>
<p>This is happening all over the nation.  State governments are taking roads <em>that have already been paid for</em> and they are turning them into toll roads.</p>
<p>I am very highly offended by this.  But amazingly, most of the politicians that are doing this keep getting voted back into office.</p>
<p>Another example is the 520 bridge in the Seattle area.  The 520 bridge is the primary connection between Bellevue and Seattle and it has already been paid for.  A lot of hard working people use that bridge to get to work.  But now they are slapping toll booths on it.</p>
<p>Will we eventually live in an America where almost all of the major roads are toll roads?</p>
<p>Don't laugh - we get a little bit closer to that every month.</p>
<p>It is just another way that government has found to suck us dry.</p>
<p>What is worse is when state governments sell roads that have already been paid for <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/our-politicians-are-selling-off-pieces-of-america-to-foreign-investors-and-goldman-sachs-is-helping-them-do-it">to foreign companies</a>.  These foreign companies are allowed to put up toll booths and charge an outrageous amount of money.</p>
<p>These deals give state governments an immediate injection of cash, but they also subject their citizens to abusive tolling for decades to come.</p>
<p>Of course when it comes to taking our money, the biggest offender is the federal government.</p>
<p>Did you know that when the federal government implemented a personal income tax back in 1913, the vast majority of the population paid a rate of just <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html">1 percent</a>?  The highest marginal rate was just <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html">7 percent</a>.</p>
<p>I sure wouldn't mind paying 1 percent today.</p>
<p>But we all know what has happened since that time.</p>
<p>Now Barack Obama wants to raise taxes once again.  Obama is portraying his plan as a tax on millionaires, but the reality is that there is a whole lot more to it than that.</p>
<p>The truth is that what he has proposed is so ridiculous that <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/bill-clinton-obama-taxes/2011/09/20/id/411720?s=al&amp;promo_code=D170-1">even Bill Clinton</a> is against <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-obama-tax-plan-is-barack-obama-plotting-to-use-class-warfare-as-a-tool-to-win-the-2012-election">the Obama tax plan</a>.</p>
<p>You see, the government has learned not to use the word "tax" so much.  Instead, words like "fees", "fines", "contributions" and "deductions" are used a lot more often these days.  A recent article <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/New-government-fees-pepper-apf-4120540659.html?x=0&amp;.v=2">posted on Yahoo News</a> documented some of the "fees" that are peppered throughout the Obama tax plan....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Airline passengers would see their federal security fees double from $5 to $10 for a nonstop round-trip flight and triple to $15 by 2017, raising $25 billion over the coming decade. Federal workers would face an additional 1.2 percentage point deduction from their paychecks to contribute $21 billion more for their pensions over the same period. Military retirees would pay a $200 fee upon turning 65 to have the government pay their out-of-pocket Medicare expenses. They'd also pay more for non-generic prescription drugs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But it is not just the federal government that is doing this kind of thing.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/smallbusiness/1109/gallery.regulation_nightmares/2.html">CNN</a> recently profiled Ray Garcia, the owner of Prestige Limousines in Boca Raton, Florida.  Garcia says that complying with government regulations takes up most of his time and he says that the fees are absolutely outrageous....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We will start with Miami, which is Dade County. You have to buy a permit, which costs anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000. Once you acquire that permit, you have to find a vehicle to put that permit on. And it has to be no older than five years old. Once that car is five years old, you have to go out and buy a new one, no matter what kind of condition you keep it in.</em></p>
<p><em>You have to get the car inspected every year. And you have to renew the luxury sedan permit every year. It would be better if you could buy just one permit for your entire fleet. But you have to buy one for each car and each car permit costs $675.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is getting really, really hard to run a small business in the United States today.  Politicians love to give speeches about how much they love small businesses, but when they get into office they just soak them dry.</p>
<p>The number of small businesses in this country continues to shrink.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 16.6 million Americans were self-employed back in December 2006.  Today, that number has shrunk <a title="to 14.5 million" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/story/2011-09-07/Fewer-people-choose-to-be-self-employed/50305432/1" target="_blank">to 14.5 million</a>.</p>
<p>Life is especially tough for small businesses that try to carry employees.  Things have gotten so bad at this point that it is really hard to justify the expense of hiring new workers.  There are so many rules, regulations and taxes that it is almost always more trouble than it is worth for small businesses.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/not-hiring-the-untold-story-of-small-business-in-america-2011-9">a recent column</a>, Charles Hugh Smith shared what one small business owner told him about why he is so hesitant to hire new workers these days....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Once I hire someone, I am party to a relationship that is full of risk. What usually happens is the "check harvesting" situation where just enough work is done to extract a paycheck. I am on the hook for matching Social Security tax, medicare tax, city occupational tax, unemployment tax, federal unemployment tax, workers comp insurance and all the abuse that goes along with that system. I have to withhold State and Federal income taxes with ridiculous penalties for late payments. Often I will get served with a garnishment or child support levy for an employee, and I am on the hook for all this. If I fail to withhold on a garnishment I become liable to pay the debt.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>After reading that, can you understand why so many small businesses are not eager to hire more people?</p>
<p>The government is sucking all of the life out of the economy.  Even the smallest businesses get cracked down on hard.</p>
<p>As I have written about previously, all over America <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/police-shut-down-lemonade-stands-and-cookies-stands-run-by-kids-all-over-america-is-there-anything-we-are-still-free-to-do-without-government-permission">lemonade stands</a> that are run by little children are being shut down by police because they are not complying with government regulations.</p>
<p>We have become a nation that is run by bureaucrats.</p>
<p>You know, things ran pretty darn well back before we had an army of bureaucrats running everything.  We had the greatest economy on the face of the planet and things were rolling along pretty good.</p>
<p>But now <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/federal-bureaucrats-get-your-dirty-hands-off-of-our-light-bulbs">federal bureaucrats</a> even tell us what kind of light bulbs we are allowed to buy.  (Thank you George W. Bush for sticking it to us with that one.)</p>
<p>If you really stop and think about it, there are very few things that we are still free to do in America today without getting government permission first.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that sounds ridiculous, but if you will stop and really think about it you will see that is correct.</p>
<p>The government has taken all of the joy out of a lot of things that used to be so much fun.</p>
<p>When I was young, I loved to go to the airport.  Flying on a plane was very exciting and most people seemed to really enjoy the process.</p>
<p>But today, our airports have been turned into prison grids.</p>
<p>Did you know that now the TSA says that it has the right to check our hair for explosives?</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly.  The following is a brief excerpt <a href="http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/TSA-Searches-Womans-Afro-Hair-for-Weapons-130220258.html">from a local NBC News report</a> about one lady that was deeply offended recently when the TSA searched her hair....</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="paragraph6"><em>Two TSA agents told her she could not go any further until they checked her hair for explosives, Brantley said.</em></p>
<p id="paragraph7"><em>She said she reluctantly allowed them to do it. The agents patted her hair down right there instead of asking to return to a private area for screening.</em></p>
<p id="paragraph8"><em>"And so she started patting my hair, and I was in tears at that point," Brantley said. "And she was digging in my scalp."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would you feel if some TSA goon was running his fingers through your hair?</p>
<p>But we are not seeing this type of security just at airports.  The federal government is even pressuring private businesses to crack down on "suspicious activity".  For example, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/09/07/140234451/under-suspicion-at-the-mall-of-america">NPR</a> recently did a story on the nightmarish security that has now been implemented at Mall of America....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Mall security reported one man because he was sitting on a bench in the corridor, "observing others while writing things down on a note pad." They worried he might be a terrorist "conducting surveillance." Turned out he was a musician waiting for a friend. Three security guards surrounded another man because they thought he was looking at them "oddly" and walking "nervously" through the amusement park; he turned out to be an insurance company manager, shopping for a watch for his son.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Do you want to be regarded as a "potential terrorist" every time you go to the mall?</p>
<p>That is what this nation is turning into.</p>
<p>In America today, we are all "potential enemies" and the government always knows better than we do.</p>
<p>Sadly, government keeps trying to even take away the freedom to raise our own children the way that we want to.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/033629_vaccinations_parental_consent.html">Natural News</a>, a new law in the state of California will allow health officials to vaccinate children as young as 12 for sexually-transmitted diseases without having to get the approval of parents....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>California's Assembly Bill 499 has already quietly passed both the California House and Senate, and today sits on the desk of Gov. Jerry Brown where it awaits his signature. The bill, which is only a single page in length, contains specific language that will allow children as young as 12 to opt for sexually-transmitted disease (STD) vaccines like HPV (Gardasil, Cervarix), Hepatitis B, and any future vaccines developed to treat STDs, without having to attain parental consent.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The ways that the government is intruding in our lives are endless.  They are putting "<a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/no-more-privacy-smart-meters-are-surveillance-devices-that-monitor-the-behavior-in-your-home-every-single-minute-of-every-single-day">smart meters</a>" into our homes, they are putting <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/big-brother-2-0-10-new-ways-that-the-government-will-be-spying-on-you-and-controlling-your-behavior">surveillance cameras</a> in school cafeterias, and in some areas they are actually <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/al-gore-agenda-21-and-population-control">digging around in our trash</a> to make sure that we are recycling properly.</p>
<p>If you want to live in a totalitarian police state, there are dozens of choices to pick from all over the globe.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be America.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p>
<p>But right now, government is becoming a little bit more oppressive every single day.</p>
<p>We need millions of Americans to stand up and start talking about these issues, because you will notice that neither major political party is even talking about the horrible abuses of our freedoms that is going on.</p>
<p>Most of us just want to live our lives, and if the government would stop interfering with us so much that would make things a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>So do you think that the government should get off our backs?  Please feel free to leave a comment with your opinion below....</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=shatteparadi-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1606" title="Billions Spent On A Cure For Cancer And Yet Cancer Rates Continue To Explode" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Billions-Spent-On-A-Cure-For-Cancer-And-Yet-Cancer-Rates-Continue-To-Explode-250x167.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="167" /></a>Why hasn't a cure for cancer been found?  We have poured billions upon billions of dollars into cancer research, and yet cancer rates continue to explode.  Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, and according to the World Health Organization the number of cancer deaths globally is expected <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/19/world-cancer-toll-research">to nearly double</a> over the next 20 years.  So why is this such a problem?  We have spent gigantic piles of money and have had hordes of scientists working on this for decades.  Every year there are countless walks, runs and fundraisers for cancer research.  The U.S. government absolutely showers cancer researchers with cash.  We are supposed to be the most "advanced" civilization that the world has ever seen.  So where is the cure for cancer?  And why does cancer keep getting worse?</p>
<p>A vast amount of resources from all over the globe is poured into cancer research, yet <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/19/world-cancer-toll-research">according to the WHO</a> about seven and a half million people will die from cancer this year alone....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>At least 12.6 million people are diagnosed with cancer around the world every year, and more than 7.5 million die of the disease – a toll that is steadily rising in every country as the population expands and people live longer, according to research by the World Health Organisation.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Not only that, <a href="http://www.who.int/cancer/en/">the WHO</a> also says that the number of global cancer deaths will almost double over the next twenty years....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Deaths from cancer worldwide are projected to continue rising, with an estimated 12 million deaths in 2030.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Nearly all U.S. families will be touched by cancer in some way, and yet our best scientists seem powerless to stop it.  According to researchers at the University of Washington, the number of new cases of breast cancer around the world has risen from approximately 640,000 back in 1980 to <a href="http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/medical/breastcancer/story/2011-09-15/Breast-cancer-rates-increase-worldwide-Study-Finds/50414632/1">over 1.6 million</a> in 2010.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound like progress.</p>
<p>But certainly cancer rates must be lower in the "more developed" areas of the world, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/19/world-cancer-toll-research">an article in the Guardian</a>, cancer rates in North America and western Europe are much, much higher than they are in Africa....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The incidence rate is rising fast in the developing world but is still markedly lower in Africa, where 88 per 100,000 people got cancer, than in North America and western Europe, where 334 and 335 people respectively per 100,000 were diagnosed.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So just what in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>Why does the developed world have such high rates of cancer?</p>
<p>Are we doing something wrong?</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I had complete and total faith in the health system.  I honestly believed that the government would not allow anything harmful to be sold in our supermarkets, so I felt free to eat and drink anything that I wanted to.</p>
<p>I also believed that if anything did go wrong, I could just go to the hospital and the doctors would fix me.</p>
<p>By the time I got out of college I was a wreck physically.  My idea of a good dinner was a huge bowl of Lucky Charms slathered in milk and chased down by a tall glass of Coca-Cola.  Afterwards I would have several chocolate chip cookies for dessert.</p>
<p>After eating like that for a while, a funny thing started happening.  I started having all kinds of physical problems.</p>
<p>I went to the doctors, and I was stunned when they couldn't fix me.</p>
<p>Eventually I learned that I had been lied to all of my life.  You see, the truth is that nearly everything we eat and nearly everything we drink is loaded with dangerous chemicals, addictive substances and destructive toxins.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the products on the shelves of the average supermarket are actually bad for your health.  The food companies know that their products will destroy our health and yet they keep adding even more chemicals and even more toxins to them.</p>
<p>You really should get educated about what is in the food that you eat.  For example, The Street recently compiled a list of <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/11012915/1/cellulose-wood-pulp-never-tasted-so-good.html">15 major food companies</a> that actually add wood pulp to our food.</p>
<p>Even many "healthy foods" are being tampered with.  A lot of our fruits and our vegetables have been <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/genetic-modification-gone-wild-10-signs-that-our-world-may-be-destined-to-resemble-a-really-bad-science-fiction-movie">genetically modified</a> and the government even puts dangerous substances such as fluoride into our drinking water.</p>
<p>Everywhere we turn we are being poisoned.  Like millions of other Americans, I once ate and drank whatever I wanted to without ever thinking about whether it was good for me or not.</p>
<p>As someone once said, many of us have been literally "digging our graves with our teeth".</p>
<p>Sadly, the vast majority of our doctors have not been trained in nutrition and preventive health.  Instead, they have been trained that the solution to any health problem is to either cut someone open or prescribe a drug.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I had complete faith in the "science" behind prescription drugs.  The government would never allow millions of Americans to take dangerous pills, right?</p>
<p>Well, later I learned that about <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/8-conspiracy-theories-about-health-that-the-mainstream-media-has-been-forced-to-admit-are-actually-true">200,000 Americans</a> a year are killed by prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Today, drugs kill more Americans than traffic accidents do.</p>
<p>Most of these deaths are caused by prescription drugs.  Just check out what <a href="http://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-drugs-epidemic-20110918,0,3886090.story">a recent Los Angeles Times investigation</a> turned up....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A review of hundreds of autopsy reports in Southern California reveals one tragic demise after another: A 19-year-old Army recruit, who had just passed his military physical, took a handful of Xanax and painkillers while partying with friends. A groom, anxious over his upcoming wedding, overdosed on a cocktail of prescription drugs. A teenage honors student overdosed on painkillers her father left in his medicine cabinet from a surgery years earlier. A toddler was orphaned after both parents overdosed on prescription drugs months apart. A grandmother suffering from chronic back pain apparently forgot she'd already taken her daily regimen of pills and ended up double dosing.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, I just assumed that if something was wrong with me I could just "pop a pill" and that would take care of the problem.  Now we are learning that "popping a pill" can get you put in the ground.  Just check out the following statistics that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-drugs-epidemic-20110918,0,3886090.story?page=2">the Los Angeles Times</a> discovered....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Drug fatalities more than doubled among teens and young adults between 2000 and 2008, years for which more detailed data are available. Deaths more than tripled among people aged 50 to 69, the Times analysis found.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, the majority of those deaths were caused by prescription drugs.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, <a title="approximately three quarters of a million people a year" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-galland-md/why-medication-can-be-dan_b_643690.html" target="_blank">approximately three quarters of a million people each year</a> are rushed to emergency rooms in the United States because of adverse reactions to prescription drugs.</p>
<p>And that is just what they are admitting to.  Most of the time when something goes wrong with a drug or a vaccine they are very eager to cover it up.</p>
<p>But the carnage has become so widespread that it is hard to hide at this point.</p>
<p>It is absolutely amazing how many prescription drugs are recalled these days.  The Food and Drug Administration reported <a title="1,742 prescription drug recalls" href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/16/news/companies/drug_recall_surge/index.htm?hpt=T2" target="_blank">1,742 prescription drug recalls</a> in 2009, which was a gigantic increase from 426 drug recalls in 2008.</p>
<p>So why were these drugs ever allowed on the market in the first place?</p>
<p>Sadly, the truth is that it is all about the money.</p>
<p>Prescription drugs are really big business in America today.</p>
<p><a title="Nearly half of all Americans" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029664_prescription_drugs_Americans.html" target="_blank">Nearly half of all Americans</a> now use prescription drugs on a regular basis according to a CDC report that was released a while back. According to the report, approximately one-third of all Americans use two or more prescription drugs, and more than ten percent of all Americans use five or more prescription drugs on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The goal of the pharmaceutical companies is to get as many of us on drugs as possible.</p>
<p>The more of us that take their drugs, the more profits they will make.</p>
<p>Amazingly, there were <a title="more than&amp;nbsp;two dozen pharmaceutical companies" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharmaceutical_companies" target="_blank">more than two dozen pharmaceutical companies</a> that made over a billion dollars in profits during 2008.</p>
<p>You better not mess with their profits either.  Anyone that comes forward with a natural cure for a major disease is brutally repressed.</p>
<p>You see, there is a whole lot of money at stake.  Vitamins and herbs cannot be patented.  If natural cures are allowed to become well known, the pharmaceutical companies could lose billions of dollars in profits.</p>
<p>If the U.S. health care system was a country, it would be <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/50-u-s-health-care-statistics-that-will-absolutely-astonish-you">the 6th largest economy</a> in the entire world.  We are talking about gigantic mountains of money.</p>
<p>Those that are getting incredibly wealthy off of the current system are not just going to quietly step aside just because you found a natural cure for some disease.</p>
<p>The cold, hard reality is that we should not expect the medical establishment to announce a "cure for cancer" any time soon.  There is way too much money to be made on treating cancer.  In fact, their profits will go even higher if even more of us get cancer.</p>
<p>As I have written about previously, the entire U.S. health care industry has become <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/25-shocking-facts-that-prove-that-the-entire-u-s-health-care-industry-has-become-one-giant-money-making-scam">a giant money making scam</a>.</p>
<p>That is not going to change any time soon, so you better learn how to take care of yourself.</p>

<p>One of the cornerstones of the Obama tax plan is a new minimum tax rate on those that make more than $1 million a year.  Obama says that the goal is to make sure that millionaires don't pay a smaller rate than middle-income taxpayers do.</p>
<p>Obama is making a smart political move by going after less than 1 percent of the population and proposing tax breaks and lots of goodies for everyone else.  This puts Republicans in the position of having to play "grinch" because of their obsession with "not raising taxes".</p>
<p>There are a whole lot more low-income and middle-income voters out there than there are wealthy voters.  In addition, nearly the entire nation is pretty much disgusted with Wall Street at this point.</p>
<p>So is now the time to attack the rich?</p>
<p>Obama apparently believes that he can get a lot of traction with this stuff.</p>
<p>In fact, Obama seems to already be in campaign mode.  Just check out <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/09/obama-unveils-3-trillion-plus-debt-cut-plan/1">what Obama</a> had to say about his new plan....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Warren Buffett's secretary shouldn't pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You know, that makes a lot of sense.  I know that I am certainly disturbed that I pay more taxes <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/03/no-taxes-for-ge/">than GE does</a>.</p>
<p>The Republicans are playing right into all of this.  Instead of crying out for reform of a system that is fundamentally unjust and completely broken, they just keep defending it.</p>
<p>If the current tax code was completely thrown out, tax rates could be lowered for all of us <strong>and</strong> revenues could be increased at the same time.</p>
<p>Comparing the current tax code to Swiss cheese is not quite accurate, because the current tax code actually has more loopholes than it has substance.  If you know what you are doing and you have the resources to play the game, you can drive a fleet of armored trucks through the holes in the tax code.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that it would not take too much imagination to eliminate the personal income tax altogether.  There was no personal income tax for most of U.S. history, and we could certainly operate the government without one.</p>
<p>But instead of getting the creative, the Republicans have decided to draw a line in the sand and defend the status quo to the bitter end.</p>
<p>What a stupid, stupid thing to do.</p>
<p>Even though his approval rating recently hit a new low, Barack Obama may just be able to use the "politics of division" to worm his way back into the White House once again in 2012.</p>
<p>Do the stupid Republicans not see what he is doing?</p>
<p>Obama's plan basically involves three steps.....</p>
<p><strong>#1)</strong> Propose a "<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-obama-jobs-plan-10-reasons-why-it-is-a-bad-joke">jobs plan</a>" that contains all sorts of juicy tax cuts for the middle class, but that also contains measures that Barack Obama knows will never, ever get approved by Congress.</p>
<p><strong>#2)</strong> Propose a "tax plan" that contains heavy new taxes on the wealthy that Barack Obama knows will never, ever get approved by Congress.</p>
<p><strong>#3)</strong> Blame the Republicans for the failure of the "jobs plan" and tell poor and middle class Americans that it failed because Republicans are opposed to having the wealthy pay their "fair share" of taxes.</p>
<p>In another shrewd move, Barack Obama has trotted out Warren Buffett to sell his new plan.  In fact, Obama is calling his millionaire tax the "Buffett Rule".  Millions of Americans will see Warren Buffett standing next to Obama and will actually be convinced that some wealthy Americans are actually eager to pay more taxes.</p>
<p>The following is what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/us/politics/obama-tax-plan-would-ask-more-of-millionaires.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp#h[TOpBbf]">the New York Times</a> had to say about the "Buffett Rule"....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Mr. Obama, in a bit of political salesmanship, will call his proposal the “Buffett Rule,” in a reference to Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who has complained repeatedly that the richest Americans generally pay a smaller share of their income in federal taxes than do middle-income workers, because investment gains are taxed at a lower rate than wages.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Not that Buffett does not make some good points.  For example, according to Buffett, he was taxed at an effective tax rate of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/us/politics/obama-tax-plan-would-ask-more-of-millionaires.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp#&amp;wtoeid=growl1_r1_v3">17.4 percent</a> for 2010, while many of his employees were taxed at a rate more than double that.</p>
<p>So is that fair?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Our current tax code is absolutely ridiculous.  It massively soaks the middle class and small businesses and it greatly favors those that can hire an army of tax lawyers.</p>
<p>The Republicans should be pushing to abolish the current tax code and to shut down the IRS.  The system we have now is inherently flawed and cannot be redeemed.</p>
<p>But instead, the Republicans have painted themselves into a corner.  They must now defend absolutely laughable tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations.</p>
<p>The new "Buffett Rule" would only affect 0.3 percent of all taxpayers.  Obama hopes to pin the economic frustrations of the bottom 90 percent on them and on the Republicans.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is how politics is played in America.  Instead of working for the good of the country, Obama has his eyes on the next election.</p>
<p>An article in <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/09/obama-unveils-3-trillion-plus-debt-cut-plan/1">USA Today</a> explained some of the other reasons why the Obama tax plan has absolutely no chance of success....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Obama also would eliminate tax breaks and loopholes that benefit oil and gas companies, hedge fund managers, and corporate jet owners -- ideas that have previously been rejected by congressional Republicans. His plan to limit deductions and exclusions for people with income above $250,000 has even been rejected by many Democrats in the past.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So then why is Obama even bothering to propose it?</p>
<p>Well, as mentioned above, Obama is "setting the table" for the 2012 election.  Even the folks in the mainstream media can see this a mile away.</p>
<p>A recent article in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/us/politics/obama-tax-plan-would-ask-more-of-millionaires.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp#h[TOpBbf]">the New York Times</a> clearly spelled out what Obama is trying to do....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Obama proposal has little chance of becoming law unless Republican lawmakers bend. But by focusing on the wealthiest Americans, the president is sharpening the contrast between Republicans and Democrats with a theme he can carry into his bid for re-election in 2012.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2011/09/19/who-wins-in-fair-share-vs-class-warfare/?iid=sl-main-lede&amp;hpt=hp_t1">an article for Time</a>, Massimo Calabresi described the political motivation behind Obama's proposal in this manner....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Politically, it’s more complicated. Clearly both sides reach their base with their message. Fair share is straight-up union talk, and will resonate with the Democrats whom Obama wants to solidify and energize ahead of a year of tough economic wrangling. Class warfare opens wealthy wallets during campaign season and taps the active, enthusiastic and antigovernment Tea Party movement, which sees socialism under every Democrat’s bed.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Republicans should be able to see what is happening.</p>
<p>They should be able to understand that defending ridiculous tax loopholes for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations is not a winning strategy.</p>
<p>But right now, the Republicans are falling right into Obama's trap.</p>
<p>What the Republicans should be doing is introducing a bold, new vision for how government finances will work in this country.</p>
<p>Sadly, that will probably never happen.  You see, the truth is that the Democrats and the Republicans both believe in the current system.  Yeah, Republicans want taxes a little lower than the Democrats do most of the time, but you don't exactly see too many Republicans running around calling for the tax code and the IRS to be abolished, do you?</p>
<p>It is time that someone told the American people the truth.</p>
<p>Our tax code is fundamentally unjust.</p>
<p>Our tax code destroys small businesses.</p>
<p>Our tax code makes us much less competitive in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>Our tax code transfers wealth from the American people to big banks and big corporations.</p>
<p>Our tax code is a horrific waste of time, energy and national resources.</p>
<p>Our tax code encourages behaviors that are counter-productive.</p>
<p>Our tax code is used by the government to pursue social engineering goals.</p>
<p>Out tax code is so vast and so complicated that no ordinary American could ever actually understand the whole thing.</p>
<p>Our tax code greatly favors the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans.</p>
<p>Our tax code is an insult to our founding fathers and it is the kind of thing they tried to prevent when they put together the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The Republicans are foolish when they defend the status quo.</p>
<p>The answer to Barack Obama is not George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The answer to Barack Obama is 1776.</p>
<p>Using class warfare to once again <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/divide-and-conquer-are-the-left-and-the-right-in-america-about-to-go-to-war-with-each-other">divide the American people</a> may help Barack Obama in the next election, but it will do nothing to solve the problems this nation is facing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our tax system will continue to produce some truly ridiculous results.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, the 400 richest Americans pay an average tax rate <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2011/07/25/the-400-richest-americans-pay-an-18-tax-rate/">of just 18%</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of you that are reading this (including myself) pay a much higher rate than that.</p>
<p>That is just plain stupid.</p>
<p>Back in the 1950s, corporate taxes accounted for about 30 percent of all federal revenue, but in 2009 corporate taxes accounted <a title="for just 6.6 percent" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html?_r=4&amp;hp" target="_blank">for just 6.6 percent</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/will-the-banksters-and-the-corpocracy-eventually-own-it-all-29-statistics-about-extreme-income-inequality-in-america-that-will-blow-your-mind">a previous article</a>, I noted some of the big corporations that make a ton of money and yet <strong>pay less than zero</strong> in taxes....</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What U.S. corporations are able to get away with is absolutely amazing.</em></p>
<p><em>The following figures come directly <a title="out of a report by Citizens for Tax Justice" href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/12corps060111.pdf" target="_blank">out of a report by Citizens for Tax Justice</a>.  These are combined figures for the tax years 2008, 2009 and 2010.</em></p>
<p><em>During those three years, all of the corporations below made a lot of money.  Yet all of them paid net taxes that were below zero for those three years combined.</em></p>
<p><em>How is that possible?  Well, it turns out that instead of paying in taxes to the federal government, they were actually getting money back.</em></p>
<p><em>So for these corporations, their rate of taxation was actually below zero.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have not seen these before, you are going to have a hard time believing some of these statistics.....</em></p>
<p><em>*Honeywell*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $4.9 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes: -$34 million</em></p>
<p><em>*Fed Ex*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $3 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes: -$23 million</em></p>
<p><em>*Wells Fargo*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $49.37 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes: -$681 million</em></p>
<p><em>*Boeing*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $9.7 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes: -$178 million</em></p>
<p><em>*Verizon*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $32.5 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes: -$951 million</em></p>
<p><em>*Dupont*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $2.1 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes -$72 million</em></p>
<p><em>*American Electric Power*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $5.89 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes -$545 million</em></p>
<p><em>*General Electric*</em></p>
<p><em>Profits: $7.7 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Taxes: -$4.7 billion</em></p>
<p><em>Are you starting to get the picture?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone out there still want to defend the current tax system?</p>
<p>Just tinkering with a few tax code provisions here and there is not going to fix things.</p>
<p>It is a system that cannot be redeemed and it needs to be abandoned.</p>
<p>So defending the status quo is just stupid.</p>
<p>The Republicans need to stop doing it.</p>
<p>If the Republicans would start calling for the tax code and the IRS to be abolished, Barack Obama would not get very far at all with his class warfare mumbo jumbo.</p>
<p>But we all know that the Republicans are not likely to do that.  Instead, it looks like they are going to rally around a RINO like <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/14-reasons-why-rick-perry-would-be-a-really-really-bad-president">Rick Perry</a> and defend the current taxation system to the bitter end.</p>
<p>America deserves better than that.</p>
