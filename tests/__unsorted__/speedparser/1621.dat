I would have argued with him, but I was too busy falling on my face. Despite my lack of coordination, I have been pretty lucky.  I have only ever broken three bones in my lifetime. The first time I broke a bone, I was in my early twenties; it was my ankle. I was taking the stairs two at a time at work, and rolled my ankle, landing on it, from one step to the ground floor. I broke my foot in three places. (My friends' response to that? "Don't go there, anymore!" Get it? Yeah, it wasn't that funny then, either).  After that, over the years, I have broken my little toe, twice. The first time, I hit my son's Rescue Heroes fire truck.  The second time, I slammed my toe into the Lego table, and I went one way, the toe went the other. Let me just say: "OW."&lt;p&gt;Honestly, though, when I twisted my ankle this weekend by taking a wrong step from the sidewalk into the flower bed, it really, really hurt. I have spent the last few days icing it and finally went to the doctor on Tuesday because I feared I had broken my foot. Thankfully, I managed to save the iPad from plummeting to the cement in what would have been a certain death. The fall I took instead was a small price to pay, but I paid dearly. The verdict: severe ankle sprain. I actually pulled some tendons. The doctor gave me a brace and I am supposed to gradually start bearing weight on it. But for now, I am mostly confined to the couch with my foot up while everyone else around me is a whirling dervish trying to accomplish what is day-to-day routine for me: cleaning, cooking, taking care of pets, driving kids where they need to go...  You would think I am enjoying this, but I can't. I don't do well being waited upon. And I really don't do well watching other people work and not accomplish things to my standards. So I am constantly getting up to do things, and my family is constantly making me sit on the couch again. Very frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KDkZXuEUPbo/TmlEeb2KLVI/AAAAAAAAC4U/S0OrJMMc-1k/s500/Photo%252520Sep%2525208%25252C%2525202011%2525203%25253A35%252520PM.jpg" target="_blank" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KDkZXuEUPbo/TmlEeb2KLVI/AAAAAAAAC4U/S0OrJMMc-1k/s397/Photo%252520Sep%2525208%25252C%2525202011%2525203%25253A35%252520PM.jpg" id="blogsy-1315521766049.5483" class="alignright" width="397" height="527" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When I do venture off the couch, it's slow going. I can't walk fast at all, I sort of shuffle around, dragging my bad ankle behind me. Right now, I am looking at a least a few weeks of the "zombie shuffle." So much fun. I sit on the couch, and the cat lies down on the blanket next to me. With the walking stick and the cat I am one shark tank away from being a super-villain, I suppose. I would also like a trap door, please.&lt;p style="text-align: center; "&gt;Still, all is not lost. At least I match my toenails, now.

The maid had been there.. The wastebasket had been emptied, the sink was wiped down and the beds had been made. Housekeeping had made another discovery, as well.  How embarrassing. My turquoise boy-cut Hanes underwear were on top of my pillow, staring at me. &lt;p&gt;I was in town for the womens' blogging convention, Blogher. Leaving my hotel room bright and early, I was rushing to get to breakfast and then my next session. That's how Blogher is..there is always somewhere to be, and always five minutes ago. Or maybe that's just me.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a terrible habit of leaving my underwear under my pillow at home. My giant dog, who can put her head upon my higher-than-normal bed, has a tendency to steal underwear that are left at the foot of the bed at night. After a few mornings of waking up to find my unmentionables had become a snack, I took aversive action. Into the hamper with those skivvies. She found them there, too. Yum yum. Munch, munch, munch, she said. That's when my underwear ended up under my pillow when I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here I was, at the Marriott, 5-star resort, and the housekeeper thinks I am &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) a pig.&lt;br&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;2) so drunk I either&lt;br&gt; A) forgot where I put my underwear&lt;br&gt; B) got lucky and was so carried away I didn't think about where my underwear were&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-v4muLlDJ3Xw/Tk2arYDHnHI/AAAAAAAAC34/-olpxRrIHFc/s500/Photo%252520Aug%25252018%25252C%2525202011%2525204%25253A02%252520PM.jpg" target="_blank" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-v4muLlDJ3Xw/Tk2arYDHnHI/AAAAAAAAC34/-olpxRrIHFc/s500/Photo%252520Aug%25252018%25252C%2525202011%2525204%25253A02%252520PM.jpg" id="blogsy-1313708771880.1895" class="alignright" width="191" height="264" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Unfortunately, the truth is a lot more boring. I didn't get drunk. I certainly didn't have sex with anyone. I simply went on auto-pilot without thinking. It's like when you drive the kids to school everyday and then forget that it's a weekend and you are going to the grocery store and you drive there only you end up halfway to school? Again, just me?&lt;p&gt;It seems silly, I won't ever see the housekeeping staff again. But I realize...I am so boring.  I can't help wishing I had at least had sexier, more interesting underwear. Something hot pink, lacy, racy and thongy? I have those, I just didn't wear them. When you get to be my age, sometimes comfort wins over sex appeal. And since I knew no one would be seeing my underwear but me, I didn't really worry about it. (What comes to mind is the age-old momism, "Did you put on clean underwear? What if you get in an accident??")  Instead, the maid not only saw my underwear, she had to touch them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I left the hotel room, I cleaned up after myself, picking up trash, making my bed, rinsing out the sink.  I checked under the pillow twice.  And I left a big tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My check-in tip on foursquare: "Check under your pillow so you find your underwear before the maid does," Social media for the win.  Don't say you haven't been warned.                                                     &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-6773560103108445632?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is my fourth Blogher, and it has treated me well, for the most part, but this year the star didn't shine nearly as brightly as it has in the past.&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
Back from BlogHer and there is one word that comes to mind for my experience: disconnected.  I know, sounds like I had an awful time, but that's not true. What is true is that there were a lot of people at BlogHer, which, at times made it very difficult to find my people. It is true that the first night I came this-close to heading back to my room after cruising The People's Party, saying hi to the scant number of people I recognized, and a few I didn't. Then, feeling like a fish out of water, I flopped on to a nearby bench,where I had a great conversation with someone I had never met.  Later I went back to the party, and found people I knew. And it was good.&lt;p&gt;It's true I spent sessions mostly alone or with new people. It's true that I ate lunch, again, mostly by myself, or with new people.  I headed into parties and saw a sea of unfamiliar faces, all of whom were already attached. My wing-woman friends didn't make it this year, so I was on my own to find companionship.. It proved to be a challenge. Because, really, how long can you hang out in a cocktail circle of people you know in real life (but better online) without seeming like some sort of creepy stalkerish person? I can tell you. Exactly ten minutes. Beep. Time to find a new circle. Ever wonder how you can be lonely in a sea of 3000? I do.  Everyone is very friendly; but where are your friends? Hopefully, you brought those with you.  That sounds pathetic. I don't mean to complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want you to feel sorry for me. In some respects, I had a great time. There &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; high points. I did a lot of dancing with friends, (When I could find them) and hung out in hotel rooms for great conversations with both old friends and new..pizza at 2 a.m. in the lobby, as well. I had some nice meals with people I basically foisted myself upon (thank you to you, by the way). In outward appearance, I am sure it looked like I was having a grand old time. I did have fun, in snippets. It was just the overall package that didn't work for me.  At some point, you get tired of inviting yourself along and just want to be included by someone who wants you there. You want to be expressly invited to dinner, to the party, to wherever, instead of just...tagging along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7Yco84GPu-c/TkDUb-_n0-I/AAAAAAAAC3k/y9mAo2PUYf4/s500/Photo%252520Aug%2525208%25252C%2525202011%25252011%25253A21%252520PM.jpg" target="_blank" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7Yco84GPu-c/TkDUb-_n0-I/AAAAAAAAC3k/y9mAo2PUYf4/s500/Photo%252520Aug%2525208%25252C%2525202011%25252011%25253A21%252520PM.jpg" id="blogsy-1312871565275.9436" class="alignright" width="500" height="333" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;On the way home, I had a lot of time to ruminate and I have decided that as much as I like Blogher, that ship has sailed. That martini has been shaken. That blog has been posted. This was Blogher #4 for me, and I think I am just done. I am at that awkward stage:  I am too old to drink 'til distraction, but I still like to stay up until the wee hours. I just feel like I have no business there, with the cool kids. I love almost everyone at Blogher,  but am a friend to few. I  enjoyed seeing people, but as far as deep connections? Few and far between. I felt in the way, a lot. If you fall off the face of social media and no one is there to see it, do you even make a sound? That's where I am right now. &lt;p&gt;I will continue to blog, and to tweet, but think during the week of Blogher, I will take a sabbatical. I am too old to feel "in the way." High school was a long, long time ago, and wasn't much fun; I really don't cherish reliving it. So I won't be doing that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever want to feel like the only girl in the room? Go to Blogher by yourself. The experience will trigger every insecurity you have ever felt. And you will find just how far you have yet to go in order to feel accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-34942906891793242?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You have the urge, but can't do the purge. The problem is not that I don't have ideas. I am so clogged up with ideas that one can't make it through the pipeline. I can't seems to narrow my focus or lessen my stress enough to actually get something of *import down on paper. I read others' blog posts and think, "I could have written that! I had that thought, I just didn't take it to fruition.&lt;p&gt;I think I need my Eighth grade english teacher. She is the one who taught me to write. She gave me permission to develop my voice; I believed that what I had to say was important, and it was. Of course, later that year, she leaned over me, took a big sniff, smelled the acrid second-hand smoke that I was marinated in from my mother smoking in the house and said, with disdain: "Do you smoke?" She was loud enough for some of my classmates to hear, and they snickered. Yes, she wasn't named Mrs. Dick for nothing. True story. But the damage was done; I believed I could write. It was in my blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daughter is also a writer, and a more prolific one than I was at her age. I would write what I called "story starters," pen several tens of pages of my "novel", then either get stuck or bored and intend to go back and add to it. Sometimes I actually did. My daughter, on the other hand, has done a program for writers called, NoNoWriMo, which is simply National Novel Writing Month. In one month, she has written 50,000 words. And not only has she done this once, but twice. I could only hope to have that kind of commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that when you are young, with nary a story to tell, the pen flows freely, almost on it's own, but once older and with more experience, it is much harder to find the time to tell the story? I consider this God's cosmic joke. I know I have a story to tell. I just can't FIND it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-6406246346905019113?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I know, I know. you come to this space to find the tongue-in-cheek witticisms to distract you from life, and I have been letting you down. in my defense, things aren't hilarious right now. And, since this space is all about me, it's well, &lt;em&gt;all about me&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What changed, you ask? From the fight with the spider to zombie conversations...what made life So Serious? About a week ago, I realized: &lt;strong&gt;This is My Life&lt;/strong&gt;. Just like that. I actually see it in caps. this is what I live. It is what it is, and it won't really get any better. I won't write the Great American Novel. I won't be rich, or glamorous. I won't rise to the top of the glass ceiling. I know, that doesn't seem that important, and I really don't want to conquer Corporate America.&lt;em&gt; But I still want the option&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are young, the world is your oyster. Pearls are there for the taking.  At twenty, you aren't a bestselling author..it's ok, there's time. In your forties, Time Is Running Out. You're old. You're washed up. You're irrelevant. Leave it to the youngsters, they have more energy, and why don't you just go and find yourself a nice rocking chair there by the fire? Yeah. NO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I am usually a fairly positive person, though I bitch a lot. I can always find the "blessing" (how I hate that word..how pious it seems, but really, no better word can be found) in the mess. There is always a silver lining. For example: In 2006, we had a house fire. The structure was still standing, but we lost damn near everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to move out into a rental for six months, with little more than the clothes on our backs. We found ourselves wandering WalMart at midnight on a Sunday because it was the only store open, and we needed underwear, people! How do you put your life back together after that? We had to buy clothes, and pajamas, and toothbrushes &lt;em&gt;and and and&lt;/em&gt;. I was in shock. It was awful. I would never wish the experience upon anyone. BUT. And here is where I am crazy: I was blessed. My faith increased, my family became closer, I learned gratitude.  I started over. Now I try to keep only those things that as William Morris put it, &lt;em&gt;"...you find to be useful or believe to be beautiful."&lt;/em&gt; And my house was completely redone, from top to bottom. For the first time, I had real bedroom furniture! And dishes that I didn't inherit from my mother! And a home that was completely my style, and brand new everything!  And that was the silver lining. I didn't blog about it, the emotions were too raw. In fact, I didn't blog at all for almost two years. That experience helps to keep it all in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to this last Sunday: I had one of the worst days that I can remember. Right now, JNerd is out of town, along with JBug. It's just me and the two youngers, fending for ourselves. Sunday afternoon, our cat started yowling and lying on the ground. He wouldn't walk, and something was wrong. So to the ER vet we went. Verdict: urinary blockage. LIFE-THREATENING emergency. Exactly the reason that vets exist. The vet needed to do some things that required sedating the cat, so I took the kids to Taco Bell for a quick bite. When I went to start the car, my battery was dead. I had to call AAA to come jump it, and hope that, since it was after hours and I couldn't call the vet, they would be understanding in case I was late. (thankfully, they were, and I wasn't). Because the battery was dead, I had to keep the car running while I picked up the cat. Environment be damned. I wasn't going to get stuck there...I had a sick cat to get the after-hours clinic for overnight treatment. And let me tell you, you haven't lived until you have pumped gas with the engine running for fear if you shut it off you will be stranded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally got home after 9 p.m. and my kids were a wreck. Tucked them in.  Made myself a drink and opened my laptop to find: &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. The screen was black, but I could hear it was on. I tried a whole lot of tech support stuff ("Did you turn it off and one again??") but it was unresponsive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a recap.. cat, battery, computer.  It comes in threes right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point, people, and I &lt;em&gt;DO&lt;/em&gt; have one... &lt;em&gt;that day sucked.&lt;/em&gt; The next day sucked as I had to get up at the buttcrack of dawn to get the cat from the Night ER vet to my regular vet. Thankfully, I had my husband's car. Once I did that, I had to get my van to Costco so that they could explain to me why my battery had failed after less than two years. Turns out Costco doesn't install or remove batteries, but it doesn't matter because &lt;em&gt;we don't have yours in stock right now anyway ma'am and there's an auto store down the street that can probably help you, have a nice day.&lt;/em&gt; Well. Fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove my van, which by some miracle started,  to Pep Boys (&lt;em&gt;who I cannot say enough nice things about, you guys!&lt;/em&gt;) Bought my battery. They took pity on the poor married lady who was abandoned by her husband for greener conventions, and took one look at the small ragamuffin in tow who was heat-bedraggled, and had me in and out of there in fifteen minutes! Fifteen minutes! New battery, yay! And, Costco gave me a full refund on my battery that failed.&lt;/p&gt;

Then it hit me... (here is where I get all treacly) &lt;em&gt;I really am blessed.&lt;/em&gt; Talk about First World Problems! We had enough money and resources to treat our sick cat. I have an auto club so that I don't get stranded when I have a problem. I have an extra car so that I could get my cat and not rely upon the kindness of my friends. I have enough money to get a new battery, and the resources to get it installed. I am rich compared to much of the world. That thought shut me up. I really have nothing to complain about. No one is dying. These are all transitional worries. I realize how obnoxious this sounds. Who really appreciated when Dad said, "Eat your peas, there are children starving in Africa?" And honestly, I got smacked when I once retorted, "Well, then, send the peas to THEM!" (made sense at the time) I am not telling you to eat your peas. I'm really not. I am telling myself. I am reminding myself that though I just turned forty_ahem ...life is not over. Life is still beautiful. My body may be changing, and my youth may be fading, but life is still good. Life is always good. Sometimes I just forget it for a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nqOf9cgPkHw/Ti8_DSvltAI/AAAAAAAAC2Y/Tt5kngGjnj4/Photo%252520Apr%25252011%25252C%2525202005%2525203%25253A06%252520PM.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nqOf9cgPkHw/Ti8_DSvltAI/AAAAAAAAC2Y/Tt5kngGjnj4/s500/Photo%252520Apr%25252011%25252C%2525202005%2525203%25253A06%252520PM.jpg" id="blogsy-1311719465428.1763" class="aligncenter" width="388" height="291" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, the cat is still at the vet, and will probably be ok. It will just be expensive. And I hate having to spend the money. But I love the fact that I have the resources to make the decisions that are required. I am not loaded monetarily by any means. It will be a stretch and we may eat cheese sandwiches for dinner for a bit. (more or less) but I am rich, in all the ways that count. And that revelation? Is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-6090169823701717770?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We were discussing our blogs and our families, and school came up.
“Oh, that’s right, you homeschool. When do you finish?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-orKNyPQqST0/TiSGJfghVbI/AAAAAAAACwI/j5Y_Vnmzazw/s1600/DSC04847.JPG" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 260px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-orKNyPQqST0/TiSGJfghVbI/AAAAAAAACwI/j5Y_Vnmzazw/s320/DSC04847.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5630772931754808754" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That question took me by surprise, not because it was asked, but because I wasn’t sure how to answer it. I mentioned something about summer, and how we had activities planned, and changed the subject. I don’t think she even noticed. The truth is, I never “finish.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


You know that awkward review time that teachers have for the first couple of months after summer break? Where they can’t really teach anything new for fear the kids don’t remember what they were taught the year before? I don’t have that. I learned long ago that my kids don’t retain much over the summer if we take a 2 or 3 month break. So? We don’t break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


We scale back, maybe. Do less than we would normally, but we keep on keeping on. And my kids progress. Don’t get me wrong, we do all the fun things over the summer that you do. We go to the park. We go to the beach. We swim. We just do our school first. And sometimes, we even do it at those places. It keeps my kids in a routine, and when it comes to autism, routines are good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


If I gave my son a months’ long break? I would never get him back into schoolwork again. He is all about what he always does and a week of the same thing means it's a habit. He needs that structure. If I allowed my little one to take a break that long? We would lose much of the ground gained in her reading and math. She continues to see her speech and reading tutor throughout the summer. She also does vision therapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


I suppose my oldest would be fine; but I have never had to push her academically. She pushes herself hard enough for the both of us. But she putters around and will finish her Psychology and get a jumpstart on her math for next year. I also expect she will pre-read some of the books for her government class next year to make it a bit easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


How does year-round school work, you ask? Don’t the kids get burnt out? Not really. For once, we don’t worry about taking a break here and there. I take a break for almost a month around the holidays. (we always keep our foot in something, to keep up routine) and if we want to take off on an impromptu visit to the grandparents in another state for a week, we can. If we travel, we can throw in some area history, or a museum visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


Here’s the thing: homeschooling isn’t just schooling at home. It’s a way of life. It’s a way of looking at life, to see what you can learn. Every experience can teach us something. My daughter learned to count at the grocery store. My son learned about life science through gardening. Is it more work to live this way? I don’t think so. I am actually one of the least-motivated people you will meet, to be honest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


I attend homeschool conventions and think, “When would I have time to do that? Formal planning doesn’t work really well here. At the beginning of the year, I do a master lesson plan for each child. We rarely finish it on the schedule I set. That’s not the point. The plan is the point. And we eventually do get done with those books, and those lessons and that plan. We just move on to the next plan. I am a learner. I am happiest when I am learning. I want my children to discover that joy of “Aha! I didn’t know that!” Showing them that learning is a way of life is how I do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Sometimes, that's helpful. So I can tell you about my run in with the crazy woman at the dog park last night and that might be healing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AQ4x-XZ0qRA/Tg9aznw0f_I/AAAAAAAACfk/NgZz6gO004I/s500/Photo%252520Feb%25252026%25252C%2525202011%2525209%25253A10%252520AM.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AQ4x-XZ0qRA/Tg9aznw0f_I/AAAAAAAACfk/NgZz6gO004I/s500/Photo%252520Feb%25252026%25252C%2525202011%2525209%25253A10%252520AM.jpg" id="blogsy-1309629763076.773" class="alignleft" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was just like any other summer night. The days are so hot that we wait to take the dog to the park until evening. That works well, most of the time. Poppy was her usual boisterous self, bouncing from one dog to the next, having a grand old time. There is a smallish Austrailian Sheperd that is pretty obnoxious. It flits back and forth, trying to herd the dogs, barking in their faces. I have seen it there for the last week or so. It likes to bark at Poppy. She pretty much takes it stride, the way she takes it all in stride. She is big, bouncy, but harmless. She is big, and black, and that seems to put people on edge who aren't familiar with Newfoundlands. Read: just about most people. There is even a name for it among newfy owners: Big Black Dog Syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poppy figures that since this dog is yapping in her face, she must want to play, so they were chasing and bouncing, so far nothing out of the ordinary. The little dog was on its back and Poppy was standing over it, the way dogs do. This crazy nut job went over and started kicking my dog! You need to understand, I am rarely more than six feet away at any given time, and usually even closer than that. I am the original "helicopter parent" when it comes to my dog. At any point, if she starts getting too rambunctious, or if the other dog looks like he isn't having fun, I pull her out of the fray, and we take a break. I am a responsible owner. I read books, I educate myself. I have learned dog body language and figured out what to watch for. My dog is not aggressive. And even in play, I would never allow my dog to go too far with another dog. So when this, for want of a better word, &lt;em&gt;bitch&lt;/em&gt;, started kicking my dog I lost it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QulEQUw84Bo/Tg9Znj7ZPLI/AAAAAAAACfc/7kWpq4pei0E/Photo%252520May%25252023%25252C%2525202011%25252012%25253A00%252520PM.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QulEQUw84Bo/Tg9Znj7ZPLI/AAAAAAAACfc/7kWpq4pei0E/s500/Photo%252520May%25252023%25252C%2525202011%25252012%25253A00%252520PM.jpg" id="blogsy-1309629763048.1296" class="alignright" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would never hit anyone. But I started yelling at her. She tried to say my dog was "biting" hers. Her dog was driving the play!  Some other guy (I cannot call him a man) who was so good at watching his dog that I never even knew which dog was his (that's sarcasm) said it was my fault and I needed to get my dog under control. Know this: Poppy is at the dog park five or six times a week. She does not have a control problem. I can pull her out when the play gets to be too much. She takes a time out. After she was attacked by another dog (and I was bitten) I worked really hard on this. His accusations were completely unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most frustrating things that I find about myself is that if I am in the right and I feel persecuted, I cannot have an argument when it gets heated. I lose all eloquence and cannot form a coherent thought. Basically, I sound like an idiot. This time, not only did that happen, I was going to cry. Time to get the hell out of there. My brain short-circuited. As I was leaving, I uttered words to make a sailor blush. I am not proud of my behavior, and I am furious at myself for acting that way. Fight or Flight kicked in and&lt;em&gt; I lost it.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to the car, I burst into tears, and promptly had a panic attack. I couldn't breathe and I felt like my heart was in shards. I continued to cry after we got home, locked myself in my room, and just couldn't function.&lt;em class="em rangy_2"&gt; What the hell is the matter with me? I just don't know. &lt;/em&gt;But after sleeping on it, I think I know a bit more of what set me off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MCwn-onSSLw/Tg9aL78C2fI/AAAAAAAACfg/-qYtNkysSXs/Photo%252520Mar%25252026%25252C%2525202011%2525206%25253A36%252520PM.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MCwn-onSSLw/Tg9aL78C2fI/AAAAAAAACfg/-qYtNkysSXs/s500/Photo%252520Mar%25252026%25252C%2525202011%2525206%25253A36%252520PM.jpg" id="blogsy-1309629763034.7783" class="alignleft" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have a stressful life. It isn't anyone's fault; it's just the way the cards were dealt. Most of the time, it's ok. Last night, it just hit the fan. I was devastated that someone was rejecting my dog. While you may want to laugh at that, consider this: it was just one more special-needs "kid" in my family who was snubbed. In other words, it was a trigger for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last seventeen or so years, I have watched one or another of my children struggle to make friends, be accepted, be loved. I have stood by while being silently judged, "&lt;em&gt;WHY can't you stop that child from tantruming/having trouble with social stimuli/being rigid?"&lt;/em&gt; I have endured the cold shoulder from parents who have decided that my child isn't worthy of their child's time because she is "different." I have watched my son embarrass himself in front of others and be completely oblivious of their reaction. I have seen my daughter be left out of social events because she doesn't like the same things as her peers, and watched her cry over her lack of acceptance. So, no, I will not apologize for losing it at the dog park when people who had&lt;em&gt; no idea&lt;/em&gt; about actual dogs judged my dog as beneath theirs. I will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize how ridiculous this sounds. &lt;strong class="strong rangy_1"&gt;She's a dog.&lt;/strong&gt; I &lt;em class="em rangy_2"&gt;get it.&lt;/em&gt; For me, it was about more than the dog. I had a reason to be angry over my dog's treatment, but the anger I really felt was misplaced. It was grief.&lt;/p&gt;

There is no Big Man On Campus in my home. Indeed, there is no campus. None of my children will get the lead in the school play, though they might be in the chorus. I did not give birth to "popular" kids. The phone doesn't ring for play dates much. I am actually ok with this. What I am not ok with is how others see them. They are smart, generally well-mannered (if you don't count the twelve year old and his twelve-year old boy behavior) and loving children. They deserve better. They deserve friends who like them for who they are. And they deserve grown ups, who should know better, that give them a chance and don't automatically write them off as playmate for their kids because they are "different." I am fucking tired of this. That's right, I just used "fucking" on my blog, for the first time, ever. I am &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. You are on notice. If you snub my child, I will call you on it. I will try to do it kindly, but I will do it. In an era when we are trying to pay attention to others' rights and difficulties, I will call you on bad behavior, leaving out my children simply because they have autism. I am done being nice. Now I am fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-7881336961474063756?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBean: Yay! When JBug goes off to college, can I redecorate the room just for me, all to myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBug: No! I will be living at home, forever, in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&lt;br&gt;[to JBean:] JBug isn't going off to college, she is living at home for a while while she is IN college. Don't sell her off just yet...you two will still be sharing a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[to JBug;] You can't live in the basement; we don't have a basement. Besides, we have Basement Cats...there would be no room in the basement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBug: JBear will be living in the basement. Playing first-person shooter video games.&lt;/p&gt;

It is usually a big deal with all the kids going up to receive their promotion certificates, and graduates of both the eighth grade and high school. I don't have any pictures; we barely managed to get there. Today was one of THOSE days.  Those who have kids with autism will understand. We just keep on, keeping on, trying not lose ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son is twelve, going on sixteen, he thinks. He has a real problem with being told what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;every interaction between us seems to go like this:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: polite request&lt;br&gt;Him: protest&lt;br&gt;me: again,with the polite request&lt;br&gt;Him: "logical" reason why he should not comply&lt;br&gt;me: a bit more forceful request&lt;br&gt;Him: complaints about how I think he is stupid/difficult/it's not his fault, it's mine&lt;br&gt;me: [frustration ensues...either walk away and take a deep breath or yell]&lt;br&gt;Him: [depending upon what I do] yells at me, how I am such an idiot and I don't get it..&lt;br&gt;me: come back,and try again, cajole/plead/explain why he would do whatever it is I wanted him to do in the first place&lt;br&gt;Him: [grudging compliance]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that he and my youngest are absolutely oil and water these days. JBean, my youngest, is usually a very happy little girl. Unfortunately, this extends to her high-pitched voice, often singing, or talking, incessantly. It makes my JBear, my son, crazy. He starts lashing out, and getting on edge, and will say mean things to her about can't she just shut up, and her voice is driving him crazy...hurtful things. She doesn't know how to fight back verbally (nor should she learn...he is out of line) so she does one of two things. She will either hit him, or yell at him. Neither of these things are particularly useful in dealing with him, and often make things worse.  Where am I, you ask? Probably the bathroom, or taking the dog out, or loading the dishwasher....I cannot be in their face 100% of the time.  They have to learn not to aggravate one another.  Of course, when there are problems, I am always right there. Often the damage is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-urkySczhhbw/TeyNsHBFaHI/AAAAAAAACb8/aaErxN04jUY/Photo%252520Jun%2525206%25252C%2525202011%2525201%25253A16%252520AM.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-urkySczhhbw/TeyNsHBFaHI/AAAAAAAACb8/aaErxN04jUY/Photo%252520Jun%2525206%25252C%2525202011%2525201%25253A16%252520AM.jpg" id="blogsy-1307349060872.6914" class="alignright" alt="" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My son has &lt;em class="em rangy_1"&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; remorse. I realize this is part of his autism, no matter how high-functioning it may be. The lack of mirror neurons that allow empathy are definitely a hindrance for him. As a teenager, his cerebral cortex is not quite connected to his brain. He is in fight or flight, all the time...he sees the entire world as against him. He is rarely sorry, and doesn't think he ever does anything wrong. He does not admit mistakes and generally has a self-absorbed entitlement attitude. I did not raise him this way, and am still trying to fix it.  Often, I feel like I am banging my head against a wall. I know he is trying...but he just has such a long way to go. I feel like I am not helping him much. &lt;em class="em rangy_1"&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; seem to be the problem, as far as he is concerned. He is oblivious to his role in the whole mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, while I was trying to finish in the kitchen, he was having a hard time with his sister. Everyone ended up yelling at everyone else, and I had had enough. JNerd tries to out yell them, and it doesn't work. I told them all I was not going to live like this anymore; I have had it.  We weren't going today, not with the way they were acting. So I decided to take a drive for a bit, to cool down. After about ten minutes, I came back, a bit calmer. Apparently, all hell had broken loose while I was gone.  My son had tried to goad my husband into a physical altercation.  He hit my husband, as hard as he could. Apparently, it was side-stepped, and I was able to defuse the situation. We ended up going to the ceremony, and everyone was on their best behavior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we returned home, I tried talking to my son, and he was not receptive at that point. He hates to be called out on his behavior, and will deflect as much as he can. I stayed calm for the most part, and finally was able to get through to him, for now. Eventually, my son did admit he was wrong, but it was several hours later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, on top of this, I also deal with a younger one who was diagnosed with autism, as well. She has her own issues, usually pertaining to transitions, change, rigidity, anxiety and MamaMustBeThereAtAllTimes. The worse he gets, the more she clings to me. The more unrest in our home the more she clings to me. She tries so hard, but she has a hard time coping at times. That means relying upon me, more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am DRAINED. Exhausted, and really questioning every decision for my children I have made thus far. I am hoping tomorrow will bring more clarity. So tonight, I sleep. And pray and hope that I figure out what I am doing wrong. Autism is &lt;em class="em rangy_1"&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. Teen boy is &lt;em class="em rangy_1"&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. Putting the two together: &lt;em class="em rangy_1"&gt;feels insurmountable&lt;/em&gt;. My migraines have gotten more frequent and worse. I don't sleep well. I am, so far, staving off the depression that threatens to crush me. (I eat well and exercise, both help) But so help me, if I survive his growth into manhood, I hope it is with my soul intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-3846860868761428469?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Nothing I write is good enough, witty enough or explains what goes on in my brain enough. I am feeling frustrated...I am well and truly blocked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I decided I am just going to write, stream of consciousness, and publish. If none of you read it, that's ok with me...I just have to get something out there.&lt;/p&gt;

---------------------------**********

&lt;p&gt;All of your life you have battled perfectionism. The more you succeed, the more pressure you feel to continue succeeding or face the thing you fear most in life: failure. Yes, you know failure is a normal part of the creative process; indeed a normal part of living. And on the surface, you can talk a good game. You Know failure is often the path to success, and that you are not a bad person if you fail. You even know that failure depends upon how you define it. Thomas Edison is purported to have said he didn't fail 99 times creating the light bulb, he simply found 99 things that didn't work, bringing him closer to that thing which would. On the surface, it sounds great. But it doesn't quell the anxiety regarding climbing higher and then going splat when you fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.happy-art.ch/Forum/Flight/Regenwald-GiantTree.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.happy-art.ch/Forum/Flight/Regenwald-GiantTree.jpg" id="blogsy-1307045316067.2856" class="alignleft" width="600" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If success is a Tree, you are stuck sitting in it, and there is no K.I.S.S.I.N.G there. Eventually, you grew tired of the vertigo when you looked down, so you stopped climbing. Oh, you made some lateral jumps here and there, but you pretty much remain safely ensconced on the sturdiest branch. When you look up, you see, high above, teetering in the wind, that all elusive *SUCCESS*...whatever that looks like. And along the way are some perilous branches that would rather break under your weight than support your journey towards the top. So, like the smart primate you are, you found the most comfortable spot and camped here. While others climbed to the top of their tree, towering above all, you sat. While they mastered the tree, and then whole forests, you sat, content in the safety of where you were. While others planted seedlings that grew into saplings and finally towered over the rest of the arboreal layer, you watched, convincing yourself that where you were was the most comfortable place; chasing dreams was impractical, and with one ill wind they would come crashing to the ground. You could not help feel a small prickling of envy. You shut it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does that mean? Simply this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are tired of working to make other people money. The only money made by "content farms" and "featured blogger" sites is made by the owners of the sites. The money doesn't trickle down to the writers. They work hard and get little in return. Most "Brands" don't have respect for bloggers; they seem to think bloggers will work for nothing. P.R. firms send out mass emails figuring bloggers will jump at whatever meager offer they send , because bloggers are just housewives anyway, and free stuff is cool. They really have no idea what to do with bloggers. Along the way, some P.R. firm will throw a couple of tickets your way that you might not have been given if not for your internet presence, and so you feel validated. At least for a while. You try to maintain your integrity, and only focus on what might be a good "fit" so that the writing is the focus. And you write. Or at least, try to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The currency in social media is renown, but it doesn't pay the bills. At the end of the day, what do you have? A blog that everyone knows, sure. Here's the thing: Other sites have steadily eroded the traffic of blogs. Conversations take place across platforms now, and the instant gratification of blog comments is mostly gone for all but a handful of the top bloggers.  And what keeps you going? Maybe this post...this idea that you must share...will be the one to catapult you to Internet Fame, and then the endorsements and syndicated column and book deals will come rolling in. Only, it doesn't happen. You've lost sight of why you started writing in the first place; before book publishers even knew blogs existed. You wrote. Because you loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have been blogging since most of the big names have. Over time, you have watched many of them get book deals, and each time, you died just a bit more inside. You always fancied yourself a writer. At almost 45, you are not saying that anymore. You are just some housewife with an internet connection and a keyboard. Nothing more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sets the big players apart? They know something you don't. They have to be visible. They promote themselves. They TELL people how good they are. And the more they say it, the more they believe it, and others believe it, too. They pitch companies and write book proposals.  They have a plan. You? You don't work that hard. You only ever wanted to write, not sell yourself. Besides, you were  always taught that good girls don't brag on themselves; they let their work do the speaking for them. That's your problem to overcome, and you really haven't. Somewhere deep inside, you still feel like you are not good enough, that you don't deserve what others have And because you cannot get past that hurdle, you cannot succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings you to where you are right now: sitting on the sturdy branch, In a tree that you never really wanted to climb in the first place, with no idea how to get down, resenting those who have mastered the game before you ever even knew the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog has become a "have to" not a "want to." It has caused my anxiety to rise at the mere thought of trying to type a collection of words and hope they make some semblance of sense. It has become a slap in the face, a reminder of what I have not accomplished.  I have no idea how to make it fun again, but I am not willing to abandon it completely. Much like an errant child, or a disobedient dog, deep down, no matter how much it pisses me off, I still love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-9085700109825457357?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Mostly.</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5061/5682205887_c9845cd35c.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5061/5682205887_c9845cd35c_m.jpg" id="blogsy-1304396486669.427" class="alignleft" alt="" width="295" height="206"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  I had “The Talk” with my son. We both survived, barely. He is twelve now, and I know what you’re thinking: &lt;em&gt;WHY are you just now having this discussion with him? Do you live under a rock? Don’t you know what kids are capable of getting into these days? Do you want your kid to be a statistic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, I get it. But you have to understand…I have tried to have The Talk with my son before this, many times. Each time, he politely rebuffed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son has High-Functioning Autism. It is as the name implies. Some professionals call it Asperger’s Syndrome. It means he has trouble with social cues, reading body language, some processing problems as well as trouble controlling his impulses, like anger. He is easily embarrased, so it didn’t surprise me that he did not want to discuss his burgeoning sexuality with his mother. This is the kid who hides his eyes if I take him with me to mall and we happen to pass the lingerie store. There have been no shortage of attempts on my part to usher him into the ways of the world. He always swore he was not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I found that he had been googling, “penis” and “breasts” I figured, protest though he may, it was time. I am a smart woman. I have safe search on, so he didn’t find anything except Wikipedia pages…no trauma. I get that kids, boys in particular, can be curious. I am just thankful that no damage was done! And I am also grateful that I have enough technical savvy to know how to lock down the computers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/90487546@N00/5682206353" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So, how do you talk with your son about something you both find highly embarrassing without losing your mind? The answer, it seems, is just do it. Do not make a big deal about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/SdR_iswZ4xI/AAAAAAAABSY/UxeF_qwD5bA/awareness-1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/SdR_iswZ4xI/AAAAAAAABSY/UxeF_qwD5bA/s500/awareness-1.jpg" id="blogsy-1304396486599.706" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="271" height="142"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Five Ways to Discuss The Subject Without Wanting to Run and Hide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Be as matter-of-fact as you can. Lay out the information without a lot of emotion, as though you were tutoring someone who speaks a different language. We are talking autism here. That is, after all, what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Refrain from idioms, editorializing, and heavy opinion. All of these will be ignored by a kid with autism. He probably won’t get most of them, anyway. It is easy to get “on a roll” and end up losing the kid halfway through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Don’t bother asking, “Do you understand?” He probably won’t admit it either way. Just lay out the information as best you can. If you are good at reading your child, you can elaborate if need be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. This is a good time to explain society’s views on women, respect, pornography…just try to do it without making the kid feel belittled. Did I like that my son googled body parts? NO. Did I tell him I don’t want him to do it anymore? YES. Did I make him feel like a bad person? Absolutely not. Kids need guidance, and that’s what I gave him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Refrain from what I call “Aesoping” even though it is very satisfying as a parent. This is basically when you say, “I told you so!” Kids learn from their experiences. You can certainly point out the learning, but don’t rub their nose in it. That only serves to make you feel bigger than he is. One-upping a child doesn’t make us better, it makes us bullies. And with a kid with autism, it makes him shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get the wrong idea. I’m no Pollyanna. It’s not all roses and sunshine around here. I was floored when I found out my son had been …exploring google. It wasn’t easy. But instead of making it about me, and my parenting, and what I am doing right or wrong, I made it about my son. Having a child going through puberty is difficult. I can only hope I have set the groundwork for my son, and that if he does have questions later he can ask instead of looking in all the wrong places for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5182/5682206353_b390f4ef6a.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5182/5682206353_b390f4ef6a.jpg" id="blogsy-1304396486669.6228" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a painless process for us both. But I have to admit: I am very glad that I only have one son! Somehow, talking to the girls is just &lt;em class="em rangy_1"&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-7635221086252476087?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I think there is some confusion as to our locale, hello? If I wanted to live in the Pacific NorthWET, I would move to Seattle, which is about as cool and hip as you can get, if you don't mind being a duck and/or being &lt;del&gt;suicidal&lt;/del&gt; wet the majority of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/90487546@N00/5652703076" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I personally do not like being either, so I live in beautiful, sunny (hello?!) Southern California. So.  &lt;br/&gt;Anyway...the bunny decided he doesn't like moist fur, so he waited until after noon to hide the eggs.  And he was sneaky.  I sent JNerd out out with JBean to get cookies for Easter brunch with our extended family. Then with the help of JBug, the eggs were "dealt with" and placed &lt;i&gt;just so&lt;/i&gt;. Then I left in the van with JBug and JBear, calling JNerd so that he could return and she could "find" the bunny's handiwork. I came right back because I "forgot my wallet."  Mission accomplished.  I don't have one picture because I was protecting my camera from the wet conditions. But take my word for it, she had fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we headed over to my sister-in-law's who generously hosts all 18 of us for brunch. My ultra-cool brothers-in-law supplied amazing cocktails, which always makes things better. Good food, good conversation...I am very fortunate to have the family that I do. There is no way I can get a picture of all of us, so here are a few of the kids.                                       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/90487546@N00/5652136159" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5309/5652703076_de34b4d2b6.jpg" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5309/5652703076_de34b4d2b6.jpg" id="blogsy-1303712493344.1191" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/90487546@N00/5652137307" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5652136159_33b68eff1f.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5652136159_33b68eff1f.jpg" id="blogsy-1303712495395.0134" class="aligncenter" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5652137307_42d36a3c6e.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5652137307_42d36a3c6e.jpg" id="blogsy-1303712493401.6013" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5307/5652817168_4c71830399.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5307/5652817168_4c71830399.jpg" id="blogsy-1303712493403.1492" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter, to you and yours!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5652142287_31e5b06cdb.jpg" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5652142287_31e5b06cdb.jpg" id="blogsy-1303712517329.6643" class="aligncenter" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-3615779308453826511?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He was a sweet man with a quick wit and an easy smile.  He put the "social" in my "social media."  He was the first person I met on twitter, and one of the first people I met in person from "the Cloud." (Not everyone is an ax murderer or an imaginary unicorn!)  I attended a few meet-ups that he attended as well. Gregg was a connector. He enjoyed his friends, and he enjoyed creating circles of friends around him.  He hosted potlucks, and Rock Band sessions...epic Rock Band sessions. We laughed, and ate and drank...and it was good. Because of him, I have a wonderful circle of friends. That's who Gregg was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Christmas, he was diagnosed with cancer. He fought, and it looked like he was winning. But it continued to progress, quickly.  A few months ago, we got together for a Rock Band party that none of us knew was going to be our last.  Soon after, he was in the hospital. We visited him. He never went home again.  He was transferred to a rehab facility, and though JNerd and I were able to visit him a few times there, he finally went to hospice in his son's home. I had hoped to visit him there, but  he died soon afterwards. I regret that I didn't get to spend time with him there...it all happened so fast!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a champion of social media, and few know that he was instrumental in bringing the internet to AT&amp;T in the beginning.  World Net was his baby, along with his team. His team won an award that sits in the Smithsonian because of it. He was the one who turned me on to the iPad. I was the one who talked him into getting his greyhound, Ares. &lt;em class="em rangy_1"&gt;"You need a dog, Gregg,"&lt;/em&gt; I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg's hobby was photography. I loved the way he saw the world. He helped me with my camera, and got me excited about taking pictures.  Just after he died, I saw this picture again. The finality in it made me ache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TbE-x9tOYWI/AAAAAAAACaQ/esWmnahNPIA/1000000649.JPG" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="https:/lh3.googleusercontent.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TbE-x9tOYWI/AAAAAAAACaQ/esWmnahNPIA/s500/1000000649.JPG" id="blogsy-1303461954956.866" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="332" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo by &lt;a href="http://ocdailyphoto.typepad.com/orange-county-daily-photo/2010/10/101910-summers-end.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://ocdailyphoto.typepad.com/orange-county-daily-photo/2010/10/101910-summers-end.html"&gt;Gregg Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The copy from the above photo is: "&lt;em&gt;You may have gone back to school, but you'll be missing me come Spring Break." &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't know how right you were, Gregg.&lt;br/&gt;Last Saturday dawned warm and sunny. The perfect California day. We boarded a boat with some of Gregg's closest friends, who, because of Gregg, became our friends as well, and we laid him to rest. Afterwards, we had a luncheon at the Bluewater Grill, complete with a Guinness and some calamari for Gregg.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/90487546@N00/5642876008" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5143/5642876008_3405b7b225.jpg" id="blogsy-1303461955043.2844" class="aligncenter" alt="" width="500" height="358"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one touched his Guinness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/90487546@N00/5642876276" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5642876276_d70fde7fa2_m.jpg" id="blogsy-1303461954998.5496" class="alignleft" alt="" width="312" height="175"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To you, my friend.

I am not particularly depressed, but I am a bit burnt out, so that has something to do with it, no doubt.  I am just not feeling it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5587435131717126722'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TYqOpheJikI/AAAAAAAACZg/yy5RRuDU8-s/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='158' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just finished raining for two days here, with a break yesterday.  Now it is raining again.  I don't really like the rain, it's depressing. I don't know why, it just is.  I am a sun kid, all the way.  It is why I live in Southern California. I think I have always been very sensitive to weather. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

When JNerd and I were first married, he had an opportunity to work for Microsoft. (this was before they were Uber-Evil) and I just knew I could not do Seattle weather. It rains there, what? 200 days out of the year?  I would be suicidal in six months. We opted to stay in Southern California, and I think we are both very happy we did so. There are certainly trade offs. For the cost of our house here, we could have a mini-mansion in almost any other state.  (Except Reston, VA, which is the only other place I ever considered moving..when JNerd worked for AOL years ago. The homes there cost as much as they do here, due to being so close to Washington D.C.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Every once in a while, I see pictures of the seasons in other states that my friends post on facebook and think, "Wow, maybe we want that. The newf would love that weather!"  And then I remember as a kid, watching my mother curse the snow and ice in Alaska as she bundled up and threw hot water on her car windshield, trying to get the ice to melt. I remember her chipping away with an ice scraper. I recall my dad, endlessly shoveling snow so that we could move the car, and I know I really don't want to deal with any of that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5587435148742321250'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TYqOqg5RZGI/AAAAAAAACZk/QxTAFco6cAQ/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='251' height='281' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here is where we stay. The weather is temperate, the people in my city are nice, and I like it here. I don't like the political climate, but unless I move to Vermont or Berkeley, that's not likely to change.  I've learned to live with it, and bite my tongue...a lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

I am not saying we would never move; if JNerd's job took us out of state, we would go. But this is home.  It is the only home the kids have ever known.   I have been here half my life now, but I am not bored. I am still finding areas I don't know. It is very easy to do so since the concentration of cities is so dense. Google Maps is a lifesaver! I am still learning city names, believe it or not!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Love it or leave it, it's home. And while the sky may let loose, I know the rain will soon come to an end, and it won't require a snow shovel, or boots or wool socks.  So all of you out there in Maine, and Wyoming, and Nova Scotia, though I admire your pictures, I will live where my toes stay relatively warm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Several aftershocks have left more damage in their wake, and the people of Christchurch sit on pins and needles waiting for what’s to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Last September, a series of earthquakes tore through Christchurch, weakening buildings, but little else. This time, the damage is far and widespread. Buildings that have been standing for hundreds of years have crumbled under the weight of this quake. Large cracks in the roads have appeared. California? This? Could be US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

I know, not my usual upbeat, humorous piece. But you see, I was just in Christchurch, last year. I fell in love with the historic old city, and I am so saddened to see what has happened there. And what do politically conscious, social media types do when we feel like we can’t do anything? We write. We publicize. So.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

If you feel that you might want to help, you can give to the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

I have a really, really good excuse this time, though.  So be nice to me, I am an emotional basket case currently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5575588859543476690'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh5.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TWB4huq22dI/AAAAAAAACX0/69mmDNDrZG4/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='212' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy, my Newfoundland, is now 13 months old, and it was time for her to be spayed. I did all due diligence, and trust my vet implicitly.  We decided, at the same time, to do what is known as a "gastropexy" which is basically a stomach tack.  The stomach is moved about 1.5 inches, and stitched to the abdominal wall. It sounds barbaric, but I assure you, it is actually helpful.  Some background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Broad-chested dogs can have a problem that we refer to as "&lt;a href="http://www.gad.net/Newf-FAQ/Newf-FAQ_11.html"&gt;bloat&lt;/a&gt;." This means that the stomach fills with gas, and cannot escape.  Often when this happens, the stomach twists, which is called torsion.  It cuts off the blood supply and you have roughly a half-hour to get the dog to the vet, or you are going to lose her.  Bloat is a concern, because we really don't know what causes it.  Some say elevated feeding bowls, some say bowls on the floor.  Too much water, stress...  there are many thoughts, but no one really can pinpoint which dog will suffer from it.  So while we had her there for her spay, we went ahead and had the gastropexy done, as well.  If it keeps her alive, it was worth it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Now that you know that, you will better understand the next part. The day we brought her home, within two hours I could tell she was in pain.  So I drove the 30 minutes back to the vet's office to get her medicine.  That first night, she was drugged out of her mind, but didn't have a lot of pain.  By Friday, she had some pain but it seemed mostly controlled.  She wouldn't stop licking, so we bought a "cone of shame" and put it on her for nighttime, since we couldn't watch her while we were sleeping. The rest of that night, she would alternatively wake up crashing around, or just stand and refuse to lie down.  For two nights now, I have been awoken with an adrenalin rush because she refuses to settle for long. I am exhausted. Luckily, today is Saturday, and JNerd let me sleep in once the dog finally collapsed into sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5575588954190341954'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh4.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TWB4nPQbZ0I/AAAAAAAACX4/z57K6HkRrz0/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='212' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip to now. Today, Saturday, she is in pain. Panting, and standing, pacing a bit. She is eating, so that's good.  I drove to the vet's office again and picked up an anti-inflammatory, to try bring down the swelling.  Poor thing will lie down, and then jump back up quickly. I think the incision or the razor burn are very uncomfortable.  If she isn't better tomorrow, I will be bringing her to the vet.  She is absolutely NOT herself, at all.  I wish there was more I could do.  Her meds are delivered via vanilla ice cream, the thing she loves more than anything in the world.  At least there is that bright spot in all of this.  But honestly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

I am worried.&lt;br/&gt;

"Mama HOW do you stay sane?" My eldest asked me this today after a marathon day that included my twelve-year old's belligerence, my youngest's obsessive behavior, a glitter mishap that looked like a fairy crime scene, fits, complaints and just overall needneedneed. I looked at her and said, "I drink." Of course I was joking. Luckily, she knew it, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5569750299813522994'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh5.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TUu6Y0wCrjI/AAAAAAAACXY/wcqCDiQtHUg/s288/5.jpg' border='0' width='110' height='110' align='left' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I started thinking, how do I remain sane in the face of two with autism, one who is turning into a testosterone-infected teenaged boy before my very eyes? Sometimes, it isn't easy. I guess I have a choice, you know? I can fall apart and cry, rail at the universe, and curl up in a fetal position (which I do end up doing upon occasion). Or? I can just take deep, cleansing breaths, try to give hugs, and get on with my day. Hugs are a stretch for me. I am not a touchy-feely person by nature. I tend to ball up into my shell when I am feeling stressed. But God, in his infinite humor, sent me a child who needs that closeness. If she is feeling on-edge, that is the first thing she wants. Me? I want quiet solitude. Funny how kids stretch us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

How do I remain sane? I take time for myself, no matter what. Even if it is just five minutes, stolen in the bathroom ("The door is NOT a speaker!") or the rendition of my favorite song by the Pogues. I close my eyes, and just...be. For sometimes 30 seconds at a time. But it gets me through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

How do I remain sane? When my husband is home, I take the dog to the dog park, 5 days a week, sometimes 6. It is the place I feel happiest. I like the people there, and I like watching the dogs. It keeps my dog tired and content. It is my stress relief. When he isn't home, I load up the kids and the dog, and go walking in a nearby park. It isn't nearly as relaxing, listening to the litany of questions, comments and obervations from a nice-year-old who is just never quiet, but it is easier than being at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

How do I remain sane? This helps, a lot: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5569750318571598914'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TUu6Z6oUNEI/AAAAAAAACXc/Ak5KkKE5WA0/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='212' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5569750333324019186'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TUu6axlkRfI/AAAAAAAACXg/TwcbeSn3LBE/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='212' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5569750355196509634'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TUu6cDEX_cI/AAAAAAAACXk/8xvQGJK429w/s288/2.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='212' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5569750376690031986'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TUu6dTI1HXI/AAAAAAAACXo/TQiYReHEWuM/s288/3.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='212' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5569750394160700130'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TUu6eUOKWuI/AAAAAAAACXs/x6eobE5OxEY/s288/4.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='212' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25170924-7624717690053333634?l=www.sendchocolatenow.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5565617649313501218'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TT0Lw5750CI/AAAAAAAACWQ/1grKcjlRCqY/s288/0.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' align='left' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need a pass. A pass for not updating my blog in..what? Three weeks?  I really haven't written &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; in that span of time.  You see, when your daughter has back surgery, it kind of puts a crimp on all plans, and definitely slows down your best intentions to put fingers to keyboard. In the scheme of pain pills, logrolling and personal servanting, it just doesn't compare.  But, I am back, and will try to be a better blogger.

The surgery went well, and with my JBug's permission, I am sharing some of her story here.  You may recall that she has scoliosis. We didn't find the curve until February of last year. In that time, it progressed fairly quickly, and when we went in for a recheck in May, it was at 63 degrees.  They do surgery for anything over 30, so you can see what the options were.  After a second opinion, it was clear she was headed for surgery.

We chose to have the surgery done before Christmas, because we were 
trying to make sure she was recovered enough to attend the trip to Kenya our church was hosting. After the surgery was scheduled, the church cancelled the trip for this year. But the wheels were set in motion, and we decided to move forward.

She had her surgery at CHOC, in Orange. They were wonderful, calming 

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5565617661520613954'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TT0LxnaTkkI/AAAAAAAACWU/StTQ_742NNk/s288/1.jpg' border='0' width='158' height='281' align='right' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
her fears with a hospital tour, answering any questions that we had. The big day arrived, and with the addition of a new pink and black fleur-de-lis blanket (which she really appreciated!) she was in pre-op and we were ready to go.  The surgery itself took about six hours, and it really flew by. I was surprised.  The family waiting room had wi-fi and I had my iPad. I occupied myself watching Netflix, which was a pretty cool thing.  Gotta love technology!

In recovery, the first words she spoke were, "I'm tired. I can't possibly be tired, I just slept for six hours." That's my girl. She spent the first night in PICU, for observation. There, we had a wonderful gift. The first nurse was the daughter of JBug's bible study leaders, and really took a personal interest in her recovery. I do not say lightly that she was my angel. I was able to sleep on the futon there, which, for all practical purposes, was pretty comfortable. I awoke to find her, the day after surgery, with the bed propped up and she was eating ice! Yay, for recovery.  That afternoon, she sat on the edge of her bed, and even stood.  By evening, she was in a regular  private room, and doing well. At CHOC, you can wear your own pajamas, and decorate your room to make it feel more comfortable. We had a small Christmas tree from her friends, but I don't have a picture of it. They have "child life specialists" who work to make your child more comfortable. They bring movies and games and check in on them, as well.  There is even a troupe of therapy dogs that visit! All of this contributed to her recovery.


&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/casadecruz/Blogg#5565617678703913682'&gt;&lt;img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/_nhPLqAY0uZE/TT0LynbH6tI/AAAAAAAACWY/m0t1mGu3MGo/s288/2.jpg' border='0' width='400' height='400' style='margin:5px'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, she continued to do well, with only one setback of nausea from pain medicine on an empty stomach. We learned quickly that she had to eat at least a bit before she took her medication. The meds did the trick, and she had very little pain. By day five, she was ready to come home.  She spent Christmas, at home, on the couch, and in her bed.  Recovery has gone well, she has even ventured out for a movie and to visit family. She has now resumed her classes, and is such a superstar. She has good and bad days, where there is some achiness, and she is saddened that she will miss marching band due to recovery, but overall, this has been a good experience. She gained 2 INCHES in height, and just wait until you see the difference! &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, she played a lamb. The year before that, a flower princess. This year, she isn't dancing in the Nutcracker. But she is seeing it. &lt;a href="http://www.mapleconservatory.com/"&gt;Maple Youth Ballet&lt;/a&gt; presents The Nutcracker, December 18th through the 23rd.  And finally, my youngest, JBean, will get to see it. She has been wanting to see it most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did see a Nutcracker, of sorts, last year.  The dancing was wonderful, as was the staging. But it was a special performance for schools and included awful narration, referencing how much more exciting it was then the Power Rangers! My daughter was disgusted. Who narrates a &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;ballet&lt;/span&gt;, she wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, we are seeing the real Nutcracker, at Irvine and Newport Beach's premier conservatory of dance, &lt;a href="http://www.mapleconservatory.com/"&gt;Maple Conservatory&lt;/a&gt;. We cannot wait. I hope this is the start of a holiday tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can attend, too. There are still seats available! Why not take a break from your holiday preparations to enjoy some family time? Tickets range from $20-$28 dollars, which is reasonable for a full-fledged production. I can't wait, and I know my daughter is filled with joy at the prospect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of the holidays. I know, hard to believe, right? My mother is a huge lover of the Christmas season. She would bake for days, shop, and stay up all night to wrap presents on Christmas Eve. Her packages were works of art. The magical mornings of peeking at the tree while it was still dark to find that Santa had been there and artfully arranged the presents are some of the best memories of my childhood.  And I want my children to have that, I do.  And I try to do all of the things my mother did, but I just...can't.  And so. I pretty much hate Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year I tell myself it will be different. I will start earlier. I will have a better attitude. But by mid-December I am usually stressed out, ready to curl up in a fetal position, and wait for it all to be over.  Instead, I pull myself up, give myself a good talking-to, and finish the preparations at the last minute amidst much self-loathing.  It isn't fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this year? Is going to be even less fun. My eldest, JBug, goes in for spinal surgery on the 15th of December, which means I have to have &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; done TEN days earlier than usual.  She will be in the hospital for at least five days, but should be home for Christmas. So I will have little time to scour the shops, maul the mall, or gilt the gift.  I have to just get it over with quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on that note, I am trying to get into the spirit faster than usual, which is why I found this little video of Newfoundland dogs dressed up for Christmas and carrying things in carts.  I hope it brings you joy.&lt;/p&gt;

JBean is 9 now, and much of the time acts closer to 5. Lately she has had a really hard time with self-regulation. She gets upset and words just fail her.  She is very verbal, just like any other kid, but when she is angry, she resorts to growling and grunting. It is hard to take, but I have to continually remind myself that it is the short-circuit of autism that causes this behavior; she is not a brat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, there wasn't much I could do when she fell into this behavior. She just had to be allowed to cool off until she could talk.  But we found an even better solution.  Our own unofficial therapy pup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poppy, we love you. And what did we ever do without you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was Poppy's first experience with meeting other Newfs. JNerd and I loaded her into the car and headed out to the Fall 2010 Draft Test. We made sure to keep a wide berth between Poppy and the entrants of the trial. We didn't want her distracting them. We were just there to watch, and to meet new people. She is not ready for competition at this point. Overall, she did really well. There was a bit of feistiness at first...after all, she had never been at Huntington Central Park before, and it is a bit different from most of the parks she has been to. It has more of a wilderness feel, I think.  But for the most part, she settled quickly.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I was able to meet another Newf.net member, Rebekah, which is another reason to be thankful for the Interwebs. Newf.net is a bulletin board I belong to, where I chat with other newfie owners from all over the world. This particular person was from the L.A. area and I was really excited to meet another newfoundland owner. It was nice to put a face to the name, and meet her pup Artie, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poppy played and sniffed a couple of other Newfoundlands, which was quite funny. Watching her see another newf for the first time: her eyes widened and she whined, and just seemed overjoyed to find dogs like her. Maybe I am anthropomorphizing too much, but it really seemed like she wanted to know them! She was able to play a bit with a couple of the dogs, and of course, next to me, she loves other dogs best.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;She also met other people, and some kids. Except for a small bit of jumping at first contact, she was very obedient. We are still working on the initial approach.  She has never had a problem with jumping up, but recently she has just started greeting people in this way. After the first small lunge, she settles and sits nicely for me. I just need to stop her from jumping up at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we were there, she settled down, and actually listened. She watched me when bikes and joggers and other dogs came by, which is a huge thing for her. She sat and lie down when I told her to stay. She shook hands and high-fived, and I was just really proud of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is now sacked out, absolutely dog-tired after her little adventure. It is a lot of fun having a Newf, and it was inspiring to see the well-trained beautiful dogs of the club members. I can see now what I have to work towards.  She'll get there. Too bad kids aren't as easily trained as dogs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="sig"&gt;T, who seems to be a dog person now&lt;/p&gt;
