		<description><![CDATA[How do you convey the idea of "conservation" without resorting to overexposed sunlight and fall foliage? You design around emotions and malleable ideas, rather than specific imagery.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.kaitberreckman.com">Kait Berreckman</a> is a supremely talented singer/songwriter here in Austin. I&#8217;m glad I got to work with her on her debut album, <em>Conservation</em>. She didn&#8217;t need anyone to belt out some hot licks on the recorder, so I stuck to designing the album artwork.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iYwINi17ZoE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Initial Brainstorming</h2>
<p>Kait started out with one idea right off the bat. She wanted to pay tribute to Joni Mitchell&#8217;s <em>Blue</em>. I thought her idea of paying tribute on the back was fantastic. It&#8217;s a nod to someone you admire and respect as an artist, but it remains subtle. In case you aren&#8217;t familiar with the back of <em>Blue</em>, take a look:</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/album-art-kait-berreckman-conservation/attachment/kait_blue_back_lg/' title='Joni Mitchell&#039;s Blue LP, back'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kait_blue_back_lg-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Joni Mitchell&#039;s Blue LP, back" title="Joni Mitchell&#039;s Blue LP, back" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/album-art-kait-berreckman-conservation/attachment/kait_blue_back_zoom/' title='Joni Mitchell&#039;s Blue LP, song listing'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kait_blue_back_zoom-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Joni Mitchell&#039;s Blue LP, song listing" title="Joni Mitchell&#039;s Blue LP, song listing" /></a>

<p>As I quickly found out, that was the easy part. The primary focus was showcasing Kait in the proper light. As one of her co-producers noted, &#8220;She&#8217;s not just another chick with a guitar, but she&#8217;s also not a &#8216;womyn&#8217;.&#8221; After diving into the early versions of the record, I completely agree. Kait crafts clever lyrics and wears her emotions out front, but she does pick up the tempo and make you stomp your feet. She&#8217;s feminine, but she&#8217;s not dainty. That could be the Nebraska in her.</p>
<p>In order to emphasize the right brand for Kait, we thought about other songwriters—mostly from the 1970s—who wrote damn good songs. Carole King. Joni Mitchell. Rickie Lee Jones. We didn&#8217;t want to go all in on the retro, but there were artists from the 60s and 70s who had the right feel that we were going for. I spent some time digging through my records, and Kait did the same. During this digging through the bins brainstorming, Kait stumbled across The Hissing of Summer Lawns, another Joni Mitchell record. She really liked the green and silver color scheme, but we didn&#8217;t want to take on the added cost of doing a 3-color custom print job versus a traditional 4-color job. We were on a budget, after all.</p>
<div id="attachment_579" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kait_hissing.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-579" title="Joni Mitchell, The Hissing of Summer Lawns" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kait_hissing-300x298.jpg" alt="Joni Mitchell, The Hissing of Summer Lawns" width="300" height="298" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Joni Mitchell, The Hissing of Summer Lawns</p></div>
<p>I thought I had a general idea of where we wanted to go. Turns out, I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The First Draft: Swing &amp; Miss</h2>
<p>One of my big fears with this project was trying to match up the handful of photographs we had with the album artwork. Kait&#8217;s mom had taken a handful of shots that were workable, but they weren&#8217;t quite fitting with what I had in my head. Hiring a photographer was going to be damn near impossible in the run-up to SXSW, plus it would add extra expense.</p>
<p>When I was digging through my records, I found a lot of artists showed off their bands in the album art. Neil Young, Rolling Stones, Elton John. CSNY. Go look it up! I stumbled across some photos of the recording that Kait had on Facebook, and had Idea No. 1.</p>

<p>Seventies feel. Warmth. A real band. Recording on tape. These are all images I was pushing forward on this design. There was one major problem. It was focused more on the recording of the actual recording of the album, not what the album was trying to say. It&#8217;s easy to get tied into an idea or style and chase it. That&#8217;s exactly where I missed here. Thankfully, Kait was willing to provide constructive criticism and answer my questions that helped me plan out a new direction.</p>
<h2>The Second Draft: Conservation without nature</h2>
<p>Kait and I had an email exchange specifically focused on &#8220;conservation&#8221;. She was firm from the get-go that <em>Conservation</em> was the title, because it was the underlying theme. The catch? Kait&#8217;s idea of &#8220;conservation&#8221; had nothing to do with nature and conservancy. In fact, she didn&#8217;t want to be misinterpreted as a hippie. Conservation, in this context, was more about conserving energy; holding back your emotions; restraining yourself. Also important, Kait didn&#8217;t want to do all the interpreting for her listeners. She wanted something that spoke to the listener in their own way, so that definition of &#8220;conservation&#8221; is entirely mine, based on how I approached this project and interpreted the record.</p>
<p>First off, I started with the green &amp; gray, from <em>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</em>. Secondly, I listened to the album front to back about a thirty thousand times, at least. One thing that kept coming up were metaphors about water, travel and the aforementioned holding back your emotions. Even resigning yourself to accepting your emotions while simultaneously wanting to crawl out of your own head for a while and just float away. Again, this is my interpretation. Without revealing all my thoughts—we would like for listeners to form their own opinions, after all—here&#8217;s what we came up with:</p>

<p>Kait&#8217;s happy, I&#8217;m happy, and I&#8217;m ready to catch the CD Release Party at Momo&#8217;s on May 5. To help kick everything off, we even whipped up a gig poster to help promote her shows:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema redesigns, but the uniqueness and remarkability of watching a movie at an Alamo Drafthouse Cinema doesn't come through on this new website at all.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen a movie at an Alamo Drafthouse, you really should make your way to Texas (or Winchester, Virginia). It&#8217;s a fun, unique movie experience that really leaves any Mall theater stuck to the floor, with kids running up and down the aisles. Alamo does an incredible job of branding their experience, from the vintage movie clips, trailers and commercials that play before your show starts (no lame trivia or commercials), to the assertive, sometimes funny, no bullshit warnings about not talking while the movie plays, to their signature events, like Quote-A-Longs, special Q&amp;A panels and genre film screenings.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2IDS_aOa5Vw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>When <a href="http://blog.originalalamo.com/2010/06/01/4263/" target="_blank">founder Tim League was announced as CEO</a> of the merged Alamo Drafthouse in June 2010, he said, &#8220;We start work immediately merging the websites, the preshow development and the menu and will start making plans to roll out these changes along with our signature Alamo programming to the other locations shortly after that.&#8221;   In December, <a href="http://www.austin360.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/austinmovies/entries/2010/12/14/alamo_drafthouse_unveils_new_l.html" target="_blank">Alamo Drafthouse unveiled the new logo design</a>, which I like. They kept the Alamo feel and recognizability, but cleaned it up. Nicely done.</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/branding/alamo-drafthouse-redesigns-website/attachment/alamo_orig/' title='Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Old Logo'><img width="290" height="197" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/alamo_orig-290x197.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Old Logo" title="Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Old Logo" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/branding/alamo-drafthouse-redesigns-website/attachment/alamo_new/' title='Alamo Drafthouse Cinema New Logo'><img width="290" height="197" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/alamo_new-290x197.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Alamo Drafthouse Cinema New Logo" title="Alamo Drafthouse Cinema New Logo" /></a>

<p>I knew the website redesign was coming, and I had seen tweets here and there that were high on the praise and eager to share excitement about the update. When I saw that @drafthouse tweeted the link, alongside the disclaimer that the <a href="http://newsite.drafthouse.com/">new Drafthouse site is still in beta</a>, I hustled over to check it out.</p>
<h3>Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Website Redesign: The Good</h3>
<p>The new layout is 100% improved over the old site. It&#8217;s way cleaner and easier to read. As you can see below, the old website was damn near a firehose of information, with way too much small type without any real hierarchy of information, hierarchy of color or discernible grid. It&#8217;s dangerously close to just being white noise.</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/branding/alamo-drafthouse-redesigns-website/attachment/alamo_home_old/' title='Alamo Drafthouse old website'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/alamo_home_old-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Alamo Drafthouse old website" title="Alamo Drafthouse old website" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/branding/alamo-drafthouse-redesigns-website/attachment/alamo_home_new/' title='Alamo Drafthouse New Website'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/alamo_home_new-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Alamo Drafthouse New Website" title="Alamo Drafthouse New Website" /></a>

<p>The nice big boxes below the featured image make it much easier to find your local theater.  In case you didn&#8217;t notice on the old site, you chose your location on the black bar that runs under Danny McBride&#8217;s mouth. Fine for frequent users, but a pain for occasional visitors.</p>
<h3>Vastly Improved Navigation</h3>
<p>The old Alamo Cinema website uses the dreaded hover navigation. Hover menus are quick, but they <a href="http://uxmovement.com/navigation/why-hover-menus-do-users-more-harm-than-good">force users to go through hover tunnels</a>, which is frustrating and rarely works very well. It ends up making navigating your site more akin to playing &#8220;Operation&#8221;, skillfully and slowly moving your mouse to reach the option you want. Thank you, Alamo, for ditching those hover menus.</p>
<h3>Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Website Redesign: The Not So Good</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong—the new Alamo Drafthouse Cinema website is nice.  The problem is, seeing a movie at the Alamo isn&#8217;t <em>nice</em>, it&#8217;s <strong>awesome. </strong>How is it awesome? Try these on for size:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alamo serves food, drinks, beer and wine. Although in my opinion, the food needs a major redesign. It&#8217;s not very good, but the names are cute.</li>
<li>Every other row of seats have been removed so servers can deliver your order.</li>
<li>Fewer seats means tons of extra leg room and no cramped quarters.</li>
<li>You talk during the movie and they will throw your ass out. Alamo also points out that &#8220;texting and tweeting totally count as talking&#8221;.</li>
<li>Where else are you going to see a night of &#8220;Very Special Episodes&#8221; of 1980s sitcoms?</li>
<li>Tough Guy Cinema: Goldeneye with cap guns and live explosions</li>
<li>How about Sunday Brunch and &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; on the big screen? Too early? They show Mad Men on Sunday nights during the season, too!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m completely spoiled here in Austin. I won&#8217;t go see a movie in a non-Alamo theater if it&#8217;s playing at an Alamo. If it&#8217;s already sold out, I&#8217;ll wait. It&#8217;s that much better than your typical movie house. And there&#8217;s the disconnect: The uniqueness and remarkableness of watching a movie at an Alamo Drafthouse Cinema doesn&#8217;t come through on this new website at all. It&#8217;s just flat. I&#8217;m hoping they sort this out as part of the revision and evolution of the new site, because this website looks like a regular ol&#8217; movie theater.</p>
<p>Check out one of the Alamo preview montages that runs before your movie starts:</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/87EW-LZclqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a better example of the Alamo Drafthouse movie going experience. Lotsa fun, kinda hip and certainly offbeat. I just don&#8217;t feel like that comes across at all in this redesign. It really won&#8217;t hurt them here in Austin, because Alamo is King; however, if they plan on expanding to new markets—and I&#8217;d bet that&#8217;s in the works—they will need to show off their best side better than they do here.</p>

<h2>Redesign Priority No. 1: Focus on the Food</h2>
<p>Gino Gabriel is a well-trained chef. He went to New England Culinary Institute, which is also where Food Network mainstay Alton Brown graduated, and the Italian Culinary Institute. He knows his food, and the previous website just didn&#8217;t seem to focus on the food as much as I thought it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We agreed that this site was missing a focal point, and that focal point really should be a nice, hot pizza coming out of the oven. I went BIG. Moved the navigation to the side, kept a slender column for copy and a small photo gallery, and they popped a big picture of a pizza in the background. In the foreground, you can see the bubbling of the cheese, the browning of the crust and the brightness of those tomatoes. Meanwhile, behind that pizza is the 800 degree wood fire in the oven. That wood fire is what gives the pizza it&#8217;s unique flavor. That wood fire is part of the Unique Selling Proposition for Fired Up Kitchen: this is not pizza that is sitting under a warming lamp: each pie is assembled and cooked to order, right in front of you.</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/redesign-fired-up-kitchen/attachment/firedup_home_new/' title='Fired Up Kitchen&#039;s new website design'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/firedup_home_new-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Fired Up Kitchen&#039;s new website design" title="Fired Up Kitchen&#039;s new website design" /></a>

<h2>Redesign Priority No. 2: Develop a new color palette</h2>
<p>Gino wanted something that better represented the fire and the intensity of the oven. Something stronger, more durable. The orange and tan just wasn&#8217;t putting forth the oomph he wanted. I shifted the palette darker yet warmer, to maroon with gold for items of attention. That meshed well with the dark, cavernous feel of the oven, which allowed the fire and colorful vegetables on the pizzas to pop.</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/redesign-fired-up-kitchen/attachment/redesign_firedup_menu/' title='The original color palette, orange and tan'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redesign_firedup_menu-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="The original color palette, orange and tan" title="The original color palette, orange and tan" /></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Redesign Priority No. 3: Create a functional calendar</h2>
<p>The old calendar was just a straight html document. If you wanted to update it, you had to go in manually. I wanted to avoid a situation where I wasn&#8217;t available to make those changes, so I found <a href="http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/">Full Calendar</a>, a jQuery calendar that integrates seamlessly with Google Calendar. That way, either Gino or myself can make updates to the calendar on the fly, anywhere we have internet access. It&#8217;s all managed and shared through Google accounts. I took a few minutes to style it to fit in, and it works like a charm.</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/redesign-fired-up-kitchen/attachment/redesign_firedup_cal/' title='The Old Fired Up Kitchen Calendar'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redesign_firedup_cal-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="The Old Fired Up Kitchen Calendar" title="The Old Fired Up Kitchen Calendar" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/redesign-fired-up-kitchen/attachment/firedup_cal_new/' title='New Fired Up Kitchen calendar page design'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/firedup_cal_new-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="New Fired Up Kitchen calendar page design" title="New Fired Up Kitchen calendar page design" /></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Redesign Priority No. 4: Make it easier to get in touch with Gino</h2>
<p>As you can see on the old Fired Up Kitchen website, the page for booking events only had a phone number. With Fired Up Kitchen out on the road all the time, that&#8217;s a recipe for disaster. By plugging in a simple contact form, people who are looking to hire Gino can send him a message with contact information and their preferred response method, either email or phone. That way, it&#8217;s all right there in his email box for easy reference and response.</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/redesign-fired-up-kitchen/attachment/redesign_firedup_booking/' title='Fired Up Kitchen: Old Book an Event Page'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redesign_firedup_booking-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Fired Up Kitchen: Old Book an Event Page" title="Fired Up Kitchen: Old Book an Event Page" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/redesign-fired-up-kitchen/attachment/firedup_book_new/' title='New and Improved Fired Up Kitchen Book an Event Page'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/firedup_book_new-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="New and Improved Fired Up Kitchen Book an Event Page" title="New and Improved Fired Up Kitchen Book an Event Page" /></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Special Bonus: Redesigned Twitter Page and New Business Cards!</h2>
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.twitter.com/firedupkitchen">@firedupkitchen</a> is up and running on Twitter, I designed a custom background that ties in with the look and feel of the new Fired Up Kitchen website. Nothing too crazy, and I didn&#8217;t put the pizza in the background because it&#8217;s way too distracting when Twitter resizes to fit monitors. I went with a wood grain texture instead, tinted to that dark, warm red that we like. I also added a picture of Gino hard at work and the classic Margherita, which is on the menu at pretty much every event.</p>
<div id="attachment_524" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redesign_firedup_twitter.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-524" title="Redesign: Fired Up Kitchen on Twitter" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/redesign_firedup_twitter-300x180.jpg" alt="Redesign: Fired Up Kitchen on Twitter" width="300" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">@firedupkitchen updated and tweeting!</p></div>
<p>Also, heading into SXSW, where Fired Up Kitchen was serving food at the free Auditorium Shores concert series, Gino let me know he was running dangerously low on business cards. We only had a matter of days, but we came up with a more rustic card that actually has his name on it (the old card didn&#8217;t). Wood and the new color scheme again leading the way.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<p>Well, things are getting into full swing right now, but we are working on some concepts for t-shirts, and some QR codes to put customers at festival in touch with Fired Up Kitchen&#8217;s social media channels. In the meantime, if you have a <a href="http://http://www.firedupkitchen.com/book-fired-up-kitchen.html" target="_blank">private party or catering event, give Gino Gabriel at Fired up Kitchen a shout!</a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[UBDJ is a cool project run by my friend Chad Swiatecki here in Austin. Every Tuesday night at 10:00 pm, Chad sets up at Side Bar and takes over the airwaves. You are more than welcome to help, you see, because during UBDJ, you bring your iPod and play whatever you would like—just don&#8217;t play the same artist twice. Chad has created a nice following for UBDJ, but he wants to market himself and promote UBDJ as a local, weekly event. We did our usual and banged around ideas over coffee, and we agreed that the real interesting part of the night is that anyone can play anything. You can play Cat Stevens and follow it up with KMFDM. Throw in some Primus and go back over to Van Morrison. There&#8217;s a real vibe of randomness and experimentation and inclusiveness about the whole gig. It&#8217;s fun. So we decided to make a series of posters that play off the idea of never knowing what&#8217;s going to pop up next, while also encouraging people to express themselves.

<p>We did our usual and banged around ideas over coffee, and we agreed that the real interesting part of the night is that anyone can play anything. You can play Cat Stevens and follow it up with KMFDM. Throw in some Primus and go back over to Van Morrison. There&#8217;s a real vibe of randomness and experimentation and inclusiveness about the whole gig. It&#8217;s fun.</p>
<p>So we decided to make a series of posters that play off the idea of never knowing what&#8217;s going to pop up next, while also encouraging people to express themselves. We also understood that these posters were going to be displayed in a bar, which isn&#8217;t exactly a well-lit area. Here&#8217;s the poster design:</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/ubdj-gig-posters/attachment/ubdj_bruce/' title='UBDJ Poster featuring Bruce Springsteen'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ubdj_bruce-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="UBDJ Poster featuring Bruce Springsteen" title="UBDJ Poster featuring Bruce Springsteen" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/ubdj-gig-posters/attachment/ubdj_gaga/' title='UBDJ poster design featuring Lady Gaga'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ubdj_gaga-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="UBDJ poster design featuring Lady Gaga" title="UBDJ poster design featuring Lady Gaga" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/portfolio/ubdj-gig-posters/attachment/ubdj_flav/' title='UBDJ gig poster design featuring Public Enemy'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ubdj_flav-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="UBDJ gig poster design featuring Public Enemy" title="UBDJ gig poster design featuring Public Enemy" /></a>

<p>Each poster plays off a couple bright, very simple colors. Cyan. Magenta. Lime green. This makes them stand out, but it also makes them easier to see in dive-y (in the good way) bar. Did you know that yellowish-green is the easiest color for your eye to see? It&#8217;s true. If you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf33ueRXMzQ" target="_blank">remember ol&#8217; Roy G. Biv</a>, then you know that yellow and green are in the middle. Very forgiving frequencies for your eyes. I also thought it fit well within the color palette for these promotional posters.</p>
<p>Other than that, each featured artist—Bruce Springsteen, Lady Gaga &amp; Public Enemy, pretty recognizable by the target market—are surrounded by other musicians of varying notoriety. Ultimately, there may be some sort of &#8220;Can You Name Everyone On The Poster&#8221; type contest during UBDJ. Other than that, very simple: Time &amp; Date info, brief explanation and a link to Chad&#8217;s <a href="http://www.twitter.com/theechad" target="_blank">@theechad Twitter feed</a>, where he gives highlights through the evening.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A client sent me a photocopy of this Keller Williams ad in the mail. It&#8217;s a disaster. 100% waste of money. Now, I have no beef with the folks at KW, so I&#8217;m going to give them some ideas on how to make this ad work. Here&#8217;s the ad, click to embiggen:</p>

<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/informative/keller-williams-terrible-qr-code-ad/attachment/kw_qr_full/' title='Keller Williams QR Code Advertisement'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/kw_qr_full-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Keller Williams QR Code advertisement" title="Keller Williams QR Code Advertisement" /></a>
<a href='http://tcorybrown.com/informative/keller-williams-terrible-qr-code-ad/attachment/kw_qr_full_markup/' title='Keller Williams QR Code ad with notes'><img width="290" height="290" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/kw_qr_full_markup-290x290.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Keller Williams QR Code ad with notes" title="Keller Williams QR Code ad with notes" /></a>

<h3>Analysis: Keller Williams magazine ads with QR Codes</h3>
<p><strong>The Good<br />
</strong>The bar code is nice and big. It scans quickly and easily. Also, since it is a prominent part of the ad, you will lure in the curious agents while making an assertive announcement that you are using QR codes as part of your marketing and advertising strategy. Very well done. After that, we&#8217;re all down hill, folks.</p>
<h3>Problem #1: Scanning the QR code leads to a site that is not optimized for mobile browsers</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>When you scan the link, it sends you to <a href="http://www.kw.com/kw/eEdge.html" target="_blank">KW&#8217;s eEdge service</a>.  That&#8217;s fine, except they do not send you to a moble optimized version of the eEdge website! How bad is that? Check out what it looks like on my phone, and how it compares to my own mobile site:</p>

<p>Keller Williams has rolled out these ads with QR Codes without optimizing the destination for a mobile browser. Therefore, whenever someone scans that barcode, the best sales pitch they get is one that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Impossible to read</li>
<li>Frustrating to navigate</li>
<li>A complete waste of their time</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing to consider when using QR codes is determining your desired result. What&#8217;s do you want to put in front of people. The second rule is to make sure your code links to a mobile-friendly pitch. Keller Williams should have the budget to get that page ready for mobile. If not, they should create mobile-friendly landing pages with a distinct call to action. If you don&#8217;t have a page optimized for mobile and don&#8217;t want to build one? Mail me a check for 80% of that ad&#8217;s budget, and put the other 20% in your pocket. You&#8217;ll come out 20% ahead.</p>
<h3>Problem #2: The headline sucks.</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t be coy! If you want someone to scan that bar code, tell them what is in it for them! &#8220;Go for it…you deserve it&#8221; is ad agency bullshit to begin with (all lowercase, too), but it is salt in the wound after I do scan it and see Problem #1 in action. Sorry, Keller Williams, but I don&#8217;t deserve the frustration of trying to navigate a full-size website on a mobile phone browser. To get you started, here&#8217;s a few ideas of why people might scan a QR code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scan for a demo of our Agent Marketing tools!</li>
<li>Scan for a special offer on our CRM software!</li>
<li>Scan to follow us on Twitter for news and updates!</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty limitless. Tell me <strong>why</strong> I should follow your directions.</p>
<h3>Problem #3: Know Your Audience</h3>
<p>This ad and service is targeted to real estate agents. It aims to show real estate agents how KW&#8217;s eEdge program can help make their jobs easier and more profitable. Great. Even though it seems like every Joe Blow out there has a smartphone these days, <strong><a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/2/comScore_Reports_December_2010_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share" target="_blank">70% of mobile phones are not smart phones</a></strong>. Granted, that number is increasing quickly, and I don&#8217;t have specific numbers for real estate agents. However, I&#8217;ve worked with real estate professionals for a decade now, and while some are very technologically savvy, I wouldn&#8217;t rate the industry as a whole more techy than your average person.</p>
<p>7 out of every 10 agents that see this ad can&#8217;t do squat with it. How do you fix that? Put a URL in the ad! You have plenty of room at the bottom to add the eEdge url.</p>
<h3>Problem #4: QR codes are new to most people. Teach and guide them when you can.</h3>
<p>If only 30% of your audience has smartphones, think about how are familiar with QR codes and have a scanner ready to fire away. If it&#8217;s half, I&#8217;d be amazed. As I said at the top, this ad is good because it draws attention and piques curiosity about QR codes. Rather than leaving your audience to fend for themselves, give them a helping hand. Let them know about <a href="http://redlaser.com/" target="_blank">Redlaser</a> for iPhone and <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/#text" target="_blank">Google Goggles</a> for Android. If you like another app better, use that one. Just give them a nudge in the right direction.</p>
<h3>Recap: How to fix the Keller Williams QR Code ad campaign</h3>
<ol>
<li>Optimize your destination for a mobile browser, or create a mobile friendly landing page. Hell, send them to your Twitter account for Facebook fan page if you have nothing else.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be cute. Tell people why they should scan your code.</li>
<li>Give people without smartphones the opportunity to check out your great product or service.</li>
<li>Teach people. Chances are, they will think the technology is neat and show their friends. Seriously.</li>
</ol>

		<description><![CDATA[If you are going to use Twitter to handle Customer Service issues, pay attention. If you don't, you'll end up as Ugly as United Airlines.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Kottke had a quick post on <a title="Kottke: Using Twitter for Customer Service" href="http://kottke.org/11/03/customer-service-on-twitter" target="_blank">using Twitter for customer service</a>, which shows how wide the gap is between those who get it and those who don&#8217;t. Yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jkottke/status/42701188373819392" target="_blank">Kottke tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think my wife is having an affair with someone named &#8220;Zappos&#8221;. He sends her a package at least every third day. I am on to you, Mr Zappos!</p></blockquote>
<p>Zappos is famous for their customer service, perhaps even <em>infamous</em> per Dusty Bottoms, so they didn&#8217;t miss a beat and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Zappos_Service/status/42703866155905024" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>@jkottke I&#8217;m sorry sir, but our relationship with your wife is strictly professional.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, it fits well within the Zappos brand, and it also shows that they aren&#8217;t just shuffling through tweets, they actually take a moment to comprehend them and reply effectively.</p>
<p>On the other hand you have <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unitedairlines" target="_blank">United Airlines</a>. Kottke relays the story of a United Airlines passenger whose flight was cancelled unexpectedly. First off, United blamed the cancellation on a robot. I don&#8217;t even know where to begin with that. But then it gets ugly.</p>
<div id="attachment_471" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ugly_unitedairlines.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-471" title="The Ugly: United Airlines Customer Service on Twitter" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ugly_unitedairlines.jpg" alt="The Ugly: United Airlines Customer Service on Twitter" width="400" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Ugly.</p></div>
<p>Frustrated, the passenger tweeted three times expressing her displeasure. @UnitedAirlines response? Silence. Upon boarding her newly booked flight the next morning (after extra hassles, too), Ms. Trott tweets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to @unitedairlines I can finally watch that Frasier episode I missed in 1994.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course this time, @unitedairlines doesn&#8217;t miss a beat, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/UnitedAirlines/status/42712093958471680" target="_blank">replying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>@dollarshort &#8220;&#8230;I hear the blues a-callin&#8217;, Tossed salad and scrambled eggs..&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tone deaf, tone deaf, tone deaf. Real customer service meets problems head on. Honestly. Just sitting back and waiting for the chance to toot your own horn endears you to no one. We already know how great you think you are. And if you ignore me when I have a real problem, what chance do you think you have to make it right before I hit the bricks to a new solution?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[QR code marketing is simple to set up, measurable and easy to implement; however, without a clear plan and tracking capabilities, you will waste your time and money.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>What the heck is a QR Code?</h1>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen them around—a square bar code with lots of chopped up black bars in it. Sort of like a regular bar code was run through a kaleidoscope. Though relatively new in the U.S., QR codes have been popular in Japan for a while. They were originally designed to keep track of manufacturing parts, but they have gained an audience as one of the hotter new ideas in marketing, especially mobile marketing. I first noticed QR codes around SXSW last year, but now they are on<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/09shirt.html" target="_blank"> t-shirts</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denverjeffrey/5315662081/" target="_blank">real estate signs</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bee721/5472563668/" target="_blank">magazine ads</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 414px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/clevercupcakes/4397152402/"><img title="QR Code Cupcakes" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4015/4397152402_e13b3cc746.jpg" alt="QR Code on a cupcake" width="404" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scannable cupcakes! Image by flickr user clevercupcakes</p></div>
<h1>So how will my customers read QR codes?</h1>
<p>Most smartphones can interpret QR codes and transmit the information that it holds. There are plenty of apps in the Apple App Store and Android Market that use the camera function of your smart phone to read and interpret the code. I like <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/#text" target="_blank">Google Goggles</a>, but there are plenty out there. This brings us to the first thing to think about before testing QR codes in your marketing plan:</p>
<p><strong>Smartphones are growing in popularity, but as right now only make up <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/mobile-snapshot-smartphones-now-28-of-u-s-cellphone-market/" target="_blank">28% of mobile phone users</a>.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s almost 3 out of every 10 people with mobile phones. That&#8217;s a good enough ratio to get you in the Baseball Hall of Fame, but a point to consider when setting your goals and expectations. 7 out of 10 people will not be able to do squat with your QR code. That doesn&#8217;t have to be a deal breaker, but something to keep in mind.</p>
<h1>How to make QR codes for your business</h1>
<p>Actually creating the codes is easy. I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://goo.gl" target="_blank">URL-shortening service from Google, Goo.gl</a>. Plug in a url, shorten it, and click &#8220;Details&#8221;. What I like about Goo.gl is that it is super simple, integrates into my existing Google accounts and has <strong>built-in tracking analytics</strong>. That&#8217;s right. Each QR code you make records how many clicks it gets, so you can test and measure how it works.</p>
<p>There are lots more out there too. URL-shortener <a href="http://bit.ly" target="_blank">bit.ly </a>has their version. I&#8217;ve heard good things about <a href="http://qrcode.kaywa.com/" target="_blank">Kaywa</a> and <a href="http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/" target="_blank">Zxing</a>, who both offer more features you can embed in your QR code, like a phone number, calendar event, SMS or map information. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.psfk.com/2009/04/louis-vuitton-x-takashi-murakami-designer-qr-codes.html" target="_blank">designer QR Code</a>s. If you prefer your barcodes rendered as multi-colored triangles, try <a href="http://tag.microsoft.com/consumer/index.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Tags</a>. I have little interest in Microsoft&#8217;s offering, to be honest. I have no need to create a separate user account and a separate scanner. I&#8217;m going to guess most of your iPhone users feel similarly.</p>
<h1>Most important: QR codes need goals</h1>
<p>Before you start slapping your brand spankin&#8217; new codes all over your car and on signs and on the butt pockets of your jeans (though that is more attractive than those giant stitched pockets that are all the rage on the Jersey Shore), you need to have a plan. <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Without a plan, you are just flailing for no particular reason, and wasting your own time. Do you want to share your contact information with a QR code on a business card? Lots of people are doing that these days. Maybe you have the best damn coffee in town, and you get a lot of foot traffic, especially tourists. Why not put your QR code on  a sign on the front door that links to your Yelp reviews? Obviously you would want to put some context with it, to give them a reason to scan it in the first place.</p>
<div id="attachment_448" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/feat_qrcodes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-448" title="QR Codes" src="http://tcorybrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/feat_qrcodes.jpg" alt="Scan this code to follow @tcb on Twitter!" width="290" height="290" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scan this code to follow @tcb on Twitter!</p></div>
<p>The key part remains: Have a plan, set some goals and measure your results over time. It will be a little more up front work, but if you are a real estate agent with two QR codes for the same listing, one on the sign rider and one on the brochure, you can analyze the clicks each gets in comparison to one another. Add a third to flyers for an open house. Over time, you should be able to gain some insight into home buyers in your market. More importantly, it will give you an edge over other agents in your market.</p>
<h1>QR codes that link to a website must have a mobile web experience</h1>
<p>Another important point. Don&#8217;t send people to your regular website with a QR code. Don&#8217;t forget: they are using a phone. If you have a mobile site, send them there. If you don&#8217;t, set up a mobile friendly site or landing page. Don&#8217;t blow it by overcomplicating things, or making your prospect fill out a long form on the phone. If you do, they are justified in coming down to your place of business and beating you with a sock full of batteries.</p>

<p>But for now, I&#8217;m off to use QR codes to get subscribers to targeted real estate email lists. How? Well, when I attach a QR code to a home listing, I know the price, the neighborhood and other specifics about the house. Using existing email listing alerts and providing a chance to opt-in, the prospect can scan the code, get information about the house and sign up for alerts on similar homes by price, neighborhood, etc.</p>
