<p><em>&#8220;The secret of acting is sincerity. If you can fake that, you&#8217;ve got it made.&#8221; <strong>George Burns</strong></em></p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, my MP (a newly-elected Tory) will go through the parliamentary lobby in support of a range of bills that he knows little about.</p>
<div id="attachment_2748" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 190px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pigsonthewing/3293022316/in/photostream/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2748 " title="Tom Watson" src="http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tom-Watson-pigsonthewing-pic.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">@tom_watson - a pin-up for networked politics? (click for pic credit)</p></div>
<p>Sure. He may have a few reflexive opinions on the general subject matter, but beyond that, like most MPs, he&#8217;ll focus upon a handful of issues that he stays on top of: Personal bugbears, issues raised my his more persistent constituents, areas in which he&#8217;s been allocated a Parliamentary or Party role.</p>
<p>And however he casts his vote, the letters pages of the local newspapers will regularly castigate him. He&#8217;ll often respond by <em>topping-and-tailing</em> cut-and-paste letters provided by someone else in his party.</p>
<p>In this respect, my MP is quite like Tom Watson &#8211; the pin-up of the networked politics. I&#8217;m sure Tom toes The Party Line when he&#8217;s not sure. In other words, my MP and Tom conspire in the fakery that sustains Party politics.<span id="more-2747"></span></p>
<p>I say that my local MP <em>quite</em> like Tom. But he&#8217;s also <em>not quite the same</em>. Earlier this summer, for instance, Tom attained a status that very few politicians have ever held. He could have walked into a bi-partisan pub and had drinks bought for him from all sides because he behaved in a way that most people think <em>good MPs</em> should.</p>
<p>But was Tom really a one-man force of nature &#8211; a campaigning multi-tasking up-all-night political polymath, on top of the details with carefully phrased rapier-like questions?</p>
<p>I yield to no-one in my admiration for him, but I really don&#8217;t think he was this superman. I say this because he did something a bit cleverer than that: He rode the <em>network</em> into battle. His 3,225 Facebook friends and 51,984 Twitter followers gave him extra eyes, ears, hands and brains. They allowed him to stretch his Parliamentary Allowance and give him all kinds of resources that he won&#8217;t need to claim for on annoying <a href="http://www.parliamentarystandards.org.uk">IPSA</a> forms.</p>
<p>Sure &#8211; he worked hard and picked his fights well. But his real talent was in finding help &#8211; and not just of a material kind.</p>
<p>Where his followers weren&#8217;t slipping him data, they were chewing over the evidence, road-testing a few ways of describing developments giving him phrases that were useful when the cameras were on. When they were doing none of those things, he got feedback &#8211; encouragement and reassurance.</p>
<p>When you know you&#8217;re onto something, it gives you that extra bounce. His self-image here didn&#8217;t need to develop that self-loathing edge that sustains <em>fake indignation</em>. A politician as exposed as Tom would never get away with that these days.</p>
<p>By embedding himself in the network, he had little choice but to apply high standards of self-criticism. Either be a genuinely <em>good guy</em>, or act his socks off every day.</p>
<p>Now contrast Tom with <a href="http://davidhiggerson.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/data-journalism-combines-with-investigative-journalism-to-leave-an-elusive-mp-with-questions-to-answer/">Sir Stuart Bell &#8211; the unobtainable member for Middlesbrough</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sir Stuart hasn’t held a constituency surgery for 14 years. He is made even harder to contact by the fact he doesn’t have a constituency office.</em></p>
<p><em>According to the paper, his response to questions about this has been to point out that he meets with members of the public by appointment instead, and people can reach him by telephone at any time.</em></p>
<p><em>So reporter Neil Macfarlane set about trying to find out how easy or otherwise it was to get in contact with the MP. Over several months, the Gazette rang Sir Stuart’s Westminster office and his home number over 100 times. No-one ever answered. That’s despite claiming staffing costs of £82,896 last year. Contrast that with Teesside’s four other MPs, all of who have their phones answered at the first attempt.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sir Stuart isn&#8217;t on Facebook or Twitter either as far as I can see. And &#8211; when we find out what he thinks &#8211; I doubt if it&#8217;s ever as nuanced or road-tested as Tom&#8217;s positions. The contrast in self-awareness as well as political competence will be eye-watering.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a heirarchy here: On the top, Tom Watson, the go-to example of the networked politician.</p>
<p>Somewhat below him is my MP (no slouch with social media by the way, but as guarded as most MPs) who is in a marginal seat and is accordingly, visibly, busy.</p>
<p>Then, a long way further down, there&#8217;s Sir Stuart, who has managed to hide way for 14 years without hosting a surgery because, in Middlesbrough, they&#8217;d probably elect a Donkey if was wearing a red rosette (Tory equivalents are undoubtely available folks!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s taken me to get to it, but here&#8217;s my question:</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re good at networking, are political parties as important to you as they were? Does Tom need to get his cut-and-paste replies from Labour HQ as often? Does he need to rely upon the whips to guide him through issues he doesn&#8217;t understand as often? Does he need to scour local committee rooms get find local canvassers who will knock on doors for him at the next election?</p>
<p>And most importantly, Tom has created a situation where he <em>has</em> to behave publically like an honest human being. In being well networked, has he redefined what representation is?</p>
<p>And should we be voting for people on the basis of their personal network more than their party rosette?</p>
<p><em>Update: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp">More on lazy politicians here</a>.</em></p>

<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 199px"><img class="  " title="Chad flag" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/4/4b/20060206171344!Flag_of_Chad.svg" alt="" width="189" height="126" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chad. High disease prevalence and not much democracy</p></div>
<p>Amartya Sen has powerfully made the case that democracy brings with it guarantees of social justice.</p>
<p>Summarising for speed, Sen has argued that democracies don&#8217;t have famines, that they provide regulatory minimum standards that ensure that earthquakes don&#8217;t result in huge death-tolls as poorly-built structures collapse, and so on.</p>
<p>In a democracy, we are very likely to have better, universal services compared to non-democracies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a familliar argument, but one that was recently subject to a fascinating twist. In <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028133.300-genes-germs-and-the-origins-of-politics.html?full=true">a recent New Scientist [£] article</a>, evolutionary biologist Randy Thornhill makes the case that democracy only <em>emerges</em> in societies in which there is a relative absense of infectious disease.</p>
<p>In summary, societies with a high prevalence of infectious diseases tend to an understandable level of xenophobia. Epidemics, after all, are often the consequence of population movements, therefore, outsiders are treated with a good deal more suspicion.<span id="more-2736"></span>In addition, class structures in such societies are likely to be more impermeable as people who are wealthy or powerful enough to be able to afford it, distance themselves from the wider population to protect themselves.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fair bit of tangential evidence cited here as well: For instance, a 2006 study by Carlos Navarette shows that &#8211; when prompted to think about disgusting objects such as spoiled food, people tend to express more nationalistic values. I also recall (from elsewhere &#8211; can&#8217;t find it now) that there was research showing more ethnocentrism among women at vulnerable stages in their pregnancies.</p>
<p>However, digging further into the article, there&#8217;s a lot to argue with in Thornhill&#8217;s conclusions. The New Scientist raises questions that this is less a function of disease than it is of general instability and fear.</p>
<p>Also, there&#8217;s lots to argue with in his definition of &#8216;democratisation&#8217; (apparently lots of referendums is one plus-point!).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a spectrum that he uses that has collectivist societies on one end (people placing the overall good of society ahead of of the freedom of action of individuals within it). Such a society, according to Thornhill, tends to be more respectful of authority, more xenophobic and more conformist. On the other end of the scale, there&#8217;s individualist societies where there&#8217;s more emphasis on openness and individual freedom.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;d like to see more digging into this particular question (and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s out there somewhere) but how does this capture Scandinavian models of government? I&#8217;ve heard arguments that Scandinavian social democracy was largely made possible by the relative <em>lack</em> of racial outsiders and that the dramatic emergence of xenophobic parties in these countries has been more pronounced than in societies more accustomed to population movements.</p>
<p>Particularly, given <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14261716">the terrible calamity that befell Norway last week</a>, this is a pressing and uncomfortable question. Norway is at once, both a very democratic country, and one in which an established <em>General Will</em> leads to a good deal of conformity.</p>
<p>This is a country where thousands of teenagers will attend an alcohol-free open-air summer camp organised by the dominant political party! Try that in the UK!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also one of the countries that has faced a dramatic political jolt from emerging populist anti-immigation parties who often treat their social settlements as values that need to be protected from <em>outsiders</em>. How does this democratic ideal address the potential challenge to its values in an age of large-scale population movements?</p>
<p>So. Do democrats have a strategy for defending democratic advances in a time of social upheaval? I&#8217;d be interested in any thoughts that this posting provokes from readers?</p>

<p>Through the Political Innovation project, I’m helping to promote <a href="http://politicosmeetgamers.eventbrite.com/">a meetup tomorrow evening between people who have experience and interests in gaming, and those of us who are very focussed on political issues</a>.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m one of the hosts, I thought it worth dropping a few conversation-starters in the mix. Issues where politicians seem to have reversed themselves into a <em>cul-de-sac</em>. Issues where a game-change could make a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most people, I have prejudices as well as arguments – please take all of these examples (listed in no particular order) in this spirit – I’d like to focus on the gamed nature of politics rather than specific evidence on these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentencing policy:</strong> Whatever you think to the way we handle criminal sentencing, it seems to be subject to pressures that don’t have much to do with reducing reoffending. Does the tension between evidence-based approaches, newspaper versions of the problem and electoral horizons and timescales resolve itself well? I don’t think so.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration policy:</strong> A similar problem – moral questions of freedom of movement, economic ones around the flexibility of the economy, sociological ones around social capital and the effect upon communities of the kind of churn that flexible economies bring</li>
<li>As I was writing this, my friend Tim Davies forwarded <a href="http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/?p=6151">this post on gaming and <strong>climate change</strong></a> (among other issues) from Duncan Green of Oxfam, so that’s another one to add into the mix.</li>
<li>Then there’s the related question of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting">participatory budgeting</a> and the potential extensions we can apply to the idea? How can choice-games be used to improve efficiency in public management (a friend working at a local PCT said to me recently that he believed that doctors often find it harder to under-prescribe or under-refer patients to hospitals because of the way their work is structured.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I’ve a few personal hobby-horses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation</strong> – how do we strike the balance between getting more people involved in policymaking, but balancing the need to ensure that segments of the population aren’t over/under represented, while ensuring that we get the benefit of expertise, experience, creative thinking and the practical input?</li>
<li><strong>Representation </strong>– how do we incentivise politicians to play their role in a more participative democracy with the public interest as their main focus?</li>
<li><strong>Journalism</strong> – (particularly relevant this week): journalists almost have a constitutional role as well – they refer to themselves as <em>the fourth estate</em> often enough. How do we incentivise them to behave like decent intelligent human beings? How do we strike the balance between the need for diversity and pluralism in the provision of news while recognising the fact that the business model has a lot of uncertainty around it? Good journalism is literally worth billions in terms of the value that it adds to the economy – but no-one’s prepared to pick up the bill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, aside from the potential for positive social change, there’s also the question of education – how far does addressing these problems increase or challenge the legitimacy of the structures that exist to tackle them?</p>
<p>Enough already! Here’s a re-run of a Ted talk that I linked to here a while ago &#8211; it makes the case for this approach better than I can.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re coming along tomorrow, please try and think of any <em>games</em> that could be changed?</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2011/06/24/should-local-councillors-be-given-ipads/#utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed">I looked</a> at <a href="http://welovelocalgovernment.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/i-councillor/">the calculations from We Love Local Government on Councillors&#8217; iPads</a> the other day, I&#8217;ve had a few conversations with people working in democratic services at various local authorities.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 199px"><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leopard_Lacewing_Cethosia_cyane_Richard_Bartz_.jpg"><img title="Leopard Lacewing Cethosia" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Leopard_Lacewing_Cethosia_cyane_Richard_Bartz_.jpg/450px-Leopard_Lacewing_Cethosia_cyane_Richard_Bartz_.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="252" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click pic for credit</p></div>
<p>It seems that the big worry is less that Councillor&#8217;s iPads will cost/save money or have any productivity/accountability gains, than that Councillors will spend council meetings futzing with their new toys instead of paying attention to procedings properly.</p>
<p>A few quick thoughts on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we worried that tweeting councillors will be interacting with the public when they should be focussing only upon the views of other elected members? And aren&#8217;t the more savvy ones doing this already with their phones?</li>
<li>Is there an upside to Councillors being able to do quick lookups and on-the-hoof research during council meetings? Will the quality of deliberation go up?</li>
<li>Are there small-c constitutional issues here? An elected councillor has legitimacy that unelected interlopers don&#8217;t have. Should it be that the only evidence that could/should be considered at a council meeting should be tabled by &#8211; or through &#8211; an elected councillor? Do councillors have a <a href="http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/category/representation/jurors-as-representatives/#utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed">quasi-jurist</a> role (not a new suggestion around here)?<span id="more-2725"></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, I&#8217;d suggest that a revolution has happened in the last fifteen years &#8211; not just in how we communicate but in how we think. I think that <a href="http://wp.me/puSiF-hc">the parable of declining spam illustrates this perfectly</a>, and we need to start thinking about the whole question of representation in the light of it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that small a question, but one that has profound implications for our governance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s late on Friday afternoon &#8211; here&#8217;s some brain-candy to chew on over the weekend.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Douglas Rushkoff &#8211; one of the most established commentators on interactive communcations explaining the cost of transparency. It&#8217;s liberating stuff &#8211; yet a lot of it seems so straightforward in Rushkoff&#8217;s hands. It often reads like the bleedin&#8217; obvious. A lot of it is aimed at the individual, discussing their rights and the way they are manipulated and exploited.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/24609135?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/24609135">Douglas Rushkoff: The Future of Transparency</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user2985104">Applied Brilliance</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much in here that seems directly aimed at a local government audience (indeed, nothing expressly) yet I&#8217;d suggest that it&#8217;s hugely important to grasp the power-relations that effect us all &#8211; and Rushkoff is great for that.</p>
<p>One possible lesson though: how important it is to engage all council employees more in engaging with local people.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s a good question that tells us a lot about some of the bigger issues in local government.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="iPad" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7c/1stGen-iPad-HomeScreen.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="216" />The London Borough of Havering are doing it, and the argument for this is that it will cut printing costs. The good people at one of my favourite blogs <a href="http://welovelocalgovernment.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/i-councillor/">We Love Local Government</a> have done some sums:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;&#8230;over that four month period, on average, the Council spent £398.48 per month to provide 17 printed copies of the Cabinet Agenda to the Councillors.  This, I think, means that in a year the Council could be spending £4383.28 on Cabinet agendas&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So. For the sake of argument, with no bulk discounts, 17 iPads at £400 a pop (the lowest priced option with only WiFi &amp; no 3G &#8211; lets assume that there&#8217;s one or two WiFi signals available in the Council chamber!) comes to £6,800. The £500 option (with 3G)? No problem &#8211; that&#8217;s £8500 for 17.</p>
<p>So assuming they don&#8217;t all lose or break them, and <em>assuming</em> they can all actually get them to work in the first place, we&#8217;re looking at an idea that will be in the black after six months or so.</p>
<p>This also assumes no productivity savings and no efficiency gains. It assumes that there is going to be no positive cultural shift and that using a new medium will add nothing to the capacity of councillors to use a new medium in new ways &#8211; to improve their representative skills. I&#8217;ve spent long periods of time working with Councillors on their use of online communications tools and the two biggest obstacles we kept hitting were this utilitarian approach to kit and training, and (or course) the outdated rules on use of communications tools for political purposes.</p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s a slam-dunk. Place the order now! However, WLLG still aren&#8217;t totally comfortable with the idea and have four observations at the end of the post:<span id="more-2707"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>These tools should never become a perk of being a Councillor.</strong> So to ensure they are tools, a business case for why Councillors need them should be put forward that shows how they can be used as tools to further the Councillor’s work.</li>
<li><strong>Use some procurement sense.</strong> As with a contract, work out your options and find the model that offers value for money for the Council.  So would another tablet Computer be able to do the required job, instead of the fancy and fashionable I-pad?</li>
<li><strong>If the Councillor breaks it, through misuse by them, then they cover the costs.</strong> At the end of the day its the Council’s property not theirs.</li>
<li><strong>This one is not a rule, more a suggestion/question.</strong> I’m not sure it would work but could the Council do a similar thing with I-pads that the Cycle to work scheme does? So the Council buys the I-pad and slowly the Councillor buys off the Council, if they want it.  Though I suppose it wouldn’t be tax-free like the cycle scheme.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d suggest that this represents a triumph of a grumpy <em>anti-politics</em> that ultimately diminishes the legitimacy of local government itself. It&#8217;s a populist starting point that negates so many other important considerations. It&#8217;s almost as though we can&#8217;t clear our throats without acknowledging the <a href="http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/">Tax Payers Alliance</a> agenda.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not blaming the good bloggers at WLLG here &#8211; it is, after all, endemic. It&#8217;s largely unchallenged by any of the main political parties that all claim ownership of the term &#8216;localism&#8217;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a two way compact between us voters and Councillors (as with all elected representatives): They strive for the highest standards in terms of civic representation (the stuff this blog bores on about all the time) and, in return, we give them a high social status and reasonable compensation to cover the <em>opportunity cost</em> of being a Councillor.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think either side of this compact is being met &#8211; I&#8217;d be interested to see how many councillors would be able to write a half-decent A-Level essay on what good representation entails &#8211; but I do think it&#8217;s time to put a bit of dignity back into local government. Someone has to make the first move.</p>
<p>Where I live, the council is no longer based in a granite monument to municipal values (the Town Hall), it&#8217;s on some campus in a part of the borough that&#8217;s awkward to get to without a car. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s an excellent <em>business case</em> for this, but there&#8217;s no way you can build a case for political decentralisation on the back of an institution that has a purely utilitarian approach to it&#8217;s democratic and administrative functions.</p>
<p>Decentralisation doesn&#8217;t happen because of some localism agenda that is dreamed up in the the think-tanks of That London. It happens because the core tensions that diminish the legitimacy of local democracy are being addressed. I see no sign of this happening any time soon.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Toby Blume &#8211; my co-host of the session on data visualisation at <a href="http://localgovcamp.posterous.com/">Local Gov Camp</a> (last Saturday in Birmingham) &#8211; has <a href="http://tobyblume.posterous.com/visual-camping-visualisation-and-opendata-at">posted his observations from the session here</a>. In addition, Nick Booth has been busy with <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2011/06/20/toby-blume-at-localgovcamp-visualising-policy-and-engaging-citizens/">two</a> <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2011/06/21/stop-pretending-data-visualisation-is-easy-bring-distributed-skills-together/">posts</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>A few standout quotes: Firstly, here&#8217;s Nick:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;&#8230;there’s a false expectation that visualising data is easy. The JFDI attitude prevalent in other areas of digital tools for local government may have created false expectations on ease of access to visualisation.</em></p>
<p><em>Other digital tools in the social web made for publishing content – such as free blog platforms, Twitter, Facebook Pages or sharing video on YouTube – are relatively straightforward to get started with and local authorities are using these tools to great effect already.</em></p>
<p><em>But ease of access to tools, having the ability to publish or the skills to find your way around a blog platform doesn’t necessarily mean you can communicate effectively. Also, you can’t learn to write well or communicate with other people by spending an afternoon reading blog posts on the subject. These are skills that take time to build up and are achieved through practice, experimentation and, frankly, well… work or experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Making an effective data visualisation of a civic issue or communicating policy ideas visually to help other people understand the issues is an involved process&#8230;&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And Toby brings something else to the table here that slightly jars with Nick&#8217;s line:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Data visualisation is very different to policy visualisation – using data presents all sorts of particular issues and challenges, relating to how you collect and manage data, design and communication skills, corporate culture and practice and purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>Policy visualisation – that is, presenting policy in a more visual and accessible way – is, I think, simpler to do. It’s about communicating potentially complex information in a friendlier and more inclusive way. It is helpful to bring good quality design skills to the process, but it’s not essential (at least my experience suggests this is the case – given the positive feedback I’ve had, despite being a design novice).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>As important as the end product (ie the visualisation) is the deliberative process of exploring the issues and ideas, reflecting different perspectives and ultimately increasing understanding of the issue</strong> [my emphasis]. This is consistent with the learning from Visualcamp – that bringing together designers, policy makers and practitioners (or ‘users’) and arming them simply with pieces of paper and pens, the process of developing a visualisation led to a rich and open discussion about the policy in question.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If there&#8217;s an argument here (and to be fair, there probably isn&#8217;t), I&#8217;m with Toby. This is not about corporate communications &#8211; it&#8217;s about the process as much as the outcome. It&#8217;s also about <a href="http://www.memeserver.co.uk/2011/06/transparency-hurting-transparency/">the small-p politics of the thing, as I outlined in this post on my work-blog</a> the other day. This is something that councils should be wanting <em>more</em> of.</p>
<p>Sure &#8211; there&#8217;s a place for a really professional description of the problem as a conversation starter &#8211; my friends at <a href="http://thinkpublic.com/case-studies/youcankingston/">ThinkPublic</a> do this beautifully.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not a <em>professional-doing-it-properly</em> vs <em>social-media-bootstrapping</em> opposition here.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the thing that we often forget about what the blogosphere has brought to public life. We focus &#8211; understandably &#8211; on the noisy activist bloggers who&#8217;ve done big game-changing things <em>(<a href="http://order-order.com/">Guido</a> / <a href="http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/">Taxpayers Alliance</a> = anti-politics, <a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/">Liberal Conspiracy</a> = new convened voice for the left, <a href="http://www.mydavidcameron.com/">MyDavidCameron</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.38degrees.org.uk/">38 Degrees</a> = social-media-as-campaign-vehicle, etc).</em> The <em>sociology</em> of the Westminster Village may be different (even worse?) as a result.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another dimension. The blogosphere &#8211; in it&#8217;s widest incarnation &#8211; is also a low level conversation. It&#8217;s another dimension to <a href="http://wp.me/pywkr-Hy">the conversational politics question that I posted on earlier today</a>. A <em>talking cure</em> in which issues are discussed and (I beleive, but can&#8217;t prove) participants rationalise and learn. Bloggers make new contacts and synthesise new ideas more quickly. And (my personal motto), <em>&#8216;I write because I don&#8217;t know what I think until I read what I say.&#8217; </em>(OK, disclosure: that&#8217;s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ha4M3uFMRGsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%27I+write+because+I+don%27t+know+what+I+think+until+I+read+what+I+say.%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aoCyc4tuu_&amp;sig=r0pV15q06AD9Z6Cn7_UoUYAeJi0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CTYCTuCEJYKLhQfLmqmfDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%27I%20write%20because%20I%20don%27t%20know%20what%20I%20think%20until%20I%20read%20what%20I%20say.%27&amp;f=false">Flannery O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s line</a>).</p>
<p>Getting school pupils to think about what information is available and how it helps them to describe what government is brings us into the realms of co-creation and co-design. We learn thing we didn&#8217;t know &#8211; and we&#8217;re asking people to describe the problem rather than getting unelected people to tell us what the solutions should be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s playful. It&#8217;s educational (for all concerned). It&#8217;s also less problematic from a democratic point of view.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll conclude here by re-posting the conclusions people drew from the session (they were buried at the back of the slideshow last time) &#8211; I think they&#8217;re a good roundup.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review required skills for LocalGov employment</li>
<li>Co-ordinate visualisation skills within local government better</li>
<li>Lower expectations on corporate style – go for authenticity rather than branding</li>
<li>Encourage people other than formal employees to present information – it’s more authentic – enable and curate rather than ‘just create’</li>
<li>Make a clearer link between participation and decision making</li>
<li>Make organisations more permissive in comms terns – making everything go through the corporate filter doesn’t work</li>
<li>When we inform – say WHY we’re informing</li>
<li>Curate walk-throughs of how people do good data visualisation – dotgovlabls/skunkworks</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I started to write a second follow-up post on the Local Gov Camp data-visualisation session (I&#8217;ll probably finish it later today) when I stumbled on <a href="http://peterlevine.ws/?p=6543">this post on conversational politics</a> (in a very wide sense of the term) from my favourite US blogger &#8211; it made the point I was inching towards better than I could:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It turns out (from a study of ethics rather than our topic, politics) that people “have a hard time offering an account of their moral reasoning that contains consistent substantive content.” They are “largely incapable of articulating their moral decision-making process in substantive, propositional terms.” Often, their responses to open-ended questions are rationalizations of what they have done, not reasons that will guide what they do.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I <a href="http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2011/06/06/democracy-and-optimal-policymaking-a-few-signposts/#utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed">posted here on some of the thinking that casts doubt on the suitability of voters to &#8230;. er &#8230; vote</a> &#8211; a sort of <em>briefing for a &#8216;devil&#8217;s advocate&#8217;</em> &#8211; and I&#8217;ve been looking for way of articulating any of the powerful reasons why the political process matters.</p>
<p>Do read the whole post because it&#8217;s very interesting on the way we  respond to multiple choice questions and how easy it is to predict our  conclusions. But something else occurs to me.</p>
<p>Peter concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We ought to give good reasons to justify (or criticize) our own actions. We should be interested in other people’s reasons and their reactions to ours. The act of interpreting the public thoughts of working-class urban youth thus has a moral motivation, even if those reasons are not strongly influential in their own lives. I don’t think that current psychological research precludes the hope that good arguments can change people’s implicit stances or premises, which then affect their behaviors.</em></p>
<p><em>In short, we should strive to understand other people’s arguments in case they are right and to decide how to respond effectively if they are not.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Surely there&#8217;s a bigger opportunity than understanding how people articulate and assert their political <em>preferences</em>? I&#8217;m really interested in the way that people go beyond this and collectively describe the problems that they face &#8211; particularly ones that aren&#8217;t well-trodden arguments that have gone mainstream.  It&#8217;s one step further away from the politics that Peter is writing about &#8211; but currently one that is monopolised by the small number of social forces that shape our perceptions and define our options so effectively.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t think of a word for that collective entity &#8211; can I just refer to it as <em>Babylon</em> seeing as I&#8217;ve got Bob Marley playing in the next room at the moment?</p>

<p>I spent Saturday at <a href="http://localgovcamp.posterous.com/">Local Government Camp</a> in Birmingham &#8211; there&#8217;ll be at least one post along here shortly based on things I learned there. But this one is here to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pauliewaulie/notes-on-the-schools-data-visualisation-localgovcamp-session">host the slides I used at the start of the conversation</a> (sorry &#8211; Slideshare is being a complete pain today and I can&#8217;t embed the slides for some reason):</p>
<p>Along with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tobyblume">@tobyblume</a>, I initiated one that was intended to be on data visualisation and how schools could be more effective partners in this. It was based on <a href="http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2011/06/16/towards-a-local-authority-wide-schools-data-hack-project/#utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed">the idea posted here the other day</a>.</p>
<p>We kicked off the session identifying what visualisation is intended to achieve &#8211; at least in democratic terms (the slides &#8211; above &#8211; are based on <a href="http://www.memeserver.co.uk/2011/06/transparency-hurting-transparency/">this post that I wrote for my business blog</a>) &#8211; and in the end we didn&#8217;t get much beyond this issue and it&#8217;s implications for local government&#8217;s corporate culture, but I think that the observations that came out of it were very useful indeed.</p>
<p>The conclusions the group reached can be seen on the final slide. I&#8217;d be interested to know if you think that there are any obvious lessons that we missed?</p>
