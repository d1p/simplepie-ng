			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;El Grito&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how <a title="Grito de Dolores - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grito_de_Dolores" target="_blank">independence day</a> is celebrated in Mexico. People gather at 23h00 on Thursday and hear the president shout &#8220;<em>Viva México</em>&#8221; on television (if you are not in Mexico City) and everyone else shouts &#8220;<em>Viva!</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I took this chance to go visit a friend who lives in Guadalajara because Friday (16th September) is a national holiday &#8211;and here is the visual recollection of all the events that unfolded over that long weekend. See them on the slideshow (below) or directly on <a title="Guadalajara 2011 on Flickr by Diegogenico" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/diegogenico/sets/72157627756807030/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Great food, great company &amp; perfect weather (reminded me much about Bogotá weather, indeed). I loved everything about this weekend, but most importantly, I was really happy to be able to experience a new rich, fascinating culture in the company of one of the warmest, kindest families I have ever met &#8211;all of this whilst experiencing the feeling of being closer to &#8220;home&#8221; than I have ever felt outside Colombia.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always said that Mexico can be summarized as a &#8220;gastronomical feast&#8221;&#8230; at least this is the impression I had after <a title="Mexico D.F. photo-set on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/diegogenico/sets/72157624081681009/" target="_blank">visiting Mexico City in 2004</a>. Guadalajara did not disappoint (nor I was expecting it to) but the food in this region was also very unique and delicious. There aren&#8217;t many photos of just food in this set, but trust me: heaps of new, unique things were consumed in record time. There is no doubt I made my metabolism work up to its max capacity.</p>
<p>The other constant theme around Guadalajara during my visit was the<a title="Juegos Panamericanos - Guadalajara 201" href="http://www.guadalajara2011.org.mx/eng/01_inicio/index.asp" target="_blank"> Pan American</a> games which will take place there in a couple of weeks. Needless to say, the city is getting a major lift and many billboards and decorations are all about this very important sporting event. Heaps of construction, yet, many brand new developments around the city.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t considered visiting Guadalajara, you should indeed. I took me by surprise just how much it has to offer as a tourist destination.</p>

I live in Austin &#8211;and <a href="http://aclfestival.com" target="_blank">Austin City Limits</a> is one of the coolest music festivals of the year in the US.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve decided to leave town [country] instead, avoid the music fest insanity and go to Mexico &#8211;Guadalajara to be exact.</p>
<p>(after all, I did go to Lollapalooza this year&#8230;)</p>
<p>It so happens that this Friday is Mexico&#8217;s Independence Day and it appears that the celebrations around this day are quite epic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be going to see a friend who lives there. She promised the party starts tonight&#8230; all throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to see how a holiday like this is celebrated there&#8230; And the food? I&#8217;m sure that will be the highlight of it all.</p>
<p>Flights from Guadalajara back to Austin are strange: they only leave early in the morning &#8211;so I actually get to come see the last day of ACL. That means I also get to see <strong>The Hand and the Heart, Broken Social Scene, Elbow, Fleet Foxes, Empire of The Sun, </strong>&amp; <strong>Arcade Fire</strong>.</p>
<p>Not a bad way to end this weekend. Watch out for incoming <a href="http://www.gramfeed.com/diego" target="_blank">Instagrams!</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good friend sent me this excellent piece by <strong>Krys Hydmore</strong>, so I thought I&#8217;d share it with everyone &amp; anyone who visits this site.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There is a risk involved in everything</em><br />
<em> Every time you share a smile</em><br />
<em> Every time you shed a tear</em><br />
<em> You are opening yourself up to hurt.</em></p>
<p><em>Some people tread slowly through life,</em><br />
<em> Avoiding the closeness risk brings,</em><br />
<em> Side-stepping the things they can&#8217;t understand</em><br />
<em> Turning away from those who care too much,</em><br />
<em> Those who care stay too long,</em><br />
<em> Those who hold too tightly.</em></p>
<p><em>There is never an easy way to love</em><br />
<em> You can not approach it cautiously</em><br />
<em> It will not wait for you to arm yourself.</em><br />
<em> It does not care if you turn away</em><br />
<em> It is everywhere, it is everything.</em></p>
<p><em>Love is the greatest of all risks.</em><br />
<em> It is not reliable, it is not cautious,</em><br />
<em> It is not sympathetic</em><br />
<em> It is unprejudiced and unmerciliess.</em><br />
<em> It strikes the strongest of mind,</em><br />
<em> And brings them to their knees in one blow.</em></p>
<p><em><span id="more-767"></span></em></p>
<p><em>Even in the best of times, love hurts.</em><br />
<em> It hurts to need, it hurts to belong,</em><br />
<em> It hurts to be the other part of someone else,</em><br />
<em> Without either of your consent.</em><br />
<em> But, from the moment it overtakes you,</em><br />
<em> It hurts worse to be all alone.</em></p>
<p><em>The risk of love never depletes;</em><br />
<em> It grows stronger and more dangerous with time.</em><br />
<em> But, it&#8217;s in the total surrender of all defense,</em><br />
<em> That we, no matter weak or strong,</em><br />
<em> No matter willing or captive,</em><br />
<em> No matter what, we truly experience love.</em></p>
<p><em>Despite the many things love is not,</em><br />
<em> Outweighing it all are the things that love is.</em><br />
<em> Love is surrender without a loss.</em><br />
<em> It is a gift without the cost.</em><br />
<em> It consumes your every thought &amp; desire,</em><br />
<em> Every breath you take.</em><br />
<em> It is the fire that fuels you</em><br />
<em> To do more than pass through life;</em><br />
<em> It urges you, instead, to live.</em></p>
<p><em>No matter the outcome, having felt love,</em><br />
<em> You will never be the same.</em><br />
<em> It may scar your heart &amp; soul</em><br />
<em> And Leave you only memories of forever.</em><br />
<em> Or, it may cause every day of your life</em><br />
<em> To feel like there is no need for tomorrow.</em><br />
<em> But, love is worth it. It is worth the risk&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>For in all of life,</em><br />
<em> <strong>Love</strong> is truly the only risk worth taking.</em></p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not exactly a new year, but you get my <a title="&quot;New Year, New York&quot;" href="http://www.diegopulido.com/new-year-new-york/" target="_blank">point</a>.</p>
<p>I am writing this only hours before I stop officially living in New York.</p>
<p>Destination: The self-proclaimed &#8220;<a title="(YouTube video link)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob5ICMZN0Uk" target="_blank">Live Music Capital of The World</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/photo-29.jpg" rel="lightbox[741]"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-742" title="Twinkle, Twinkle Lonestar" src="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/photo-29-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NYC: Past &amp; Present</strong></p>
<p>It has been only six months ago since I loaded most of my clothes and my laptop in a mini van and drove all the way from Indianapolis to New York to start a new job (and a new life) in a city I had always wanted to live in.</p>
<p>A year after graduating from my Masters in HCI at Indiana University and after almost 4 years of working as an Interaction Designer at Pearson Education, I came to New York to work as a User Experience Designer in a agency &#8211;more as consultant instead of &#8220;in house&#8221; designer.</p>
<p>The experience was&#8230; interesting&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-741"></span></p>
<p>In terms of work, I found myself in a different environment where I was able to learn new things, not only about the industry but also about myself (personally and professionally).</p>
<p>Many of you reading this may recall I did run into a few &#8220;bumps&#8221; at first , but overall it was good to try being comfortable outside my comfort zone: working directly with clients, learning new work rhythms , tighter deadlines &#8211;even trying to work witn MS Visio! Despite constantly reminding myself how great it was to be able to work with OmniGraffle in the oast, learning a new skill is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stay long in this company for a couple of reasons &#8211;mainly due to finding a great new job (more on that below), but for what it&#8217;s worth: Thank you, Roundarch.</p>
<p>In terms of living in New York City, I can&#8217;t say it was anything short of &#8220;absolutely amazing&#8221;. Not perfect &#8211;but amazing, indeed.</p>
<p>Everything they say about NYC is true, people&#8230;</p>
<p>Someone once told me &#8220;New York is a drug&#8221;. Now I can see why</p>
<p>Despite moving in the middle of one of the nastiest winters New Yorkers have ever experienced, I grew to love this city more and more every day. I only lived here 6 months, but given all the things I did, the places I visited and the people I met, it felt like I was here <em>well</em> over a year.</p>
<p>With a city that has so much to offer, I sure made the best out of every day here, but none of this would have been the shadow of what it was had it not been for the people. Yes: there&#8217;s an 80% chance that <strong>you</strong>, reading this right now are one of them.</p>
<p>To all of you New Yorkers who I knew before I came, but also all of you whom I met after moving here: you&#8217;ve made my time here special and truly unforgettable. <em>Thank you so very much</em>. It&#8217;s people like you (you know who you are) who make NYC feel like home to me now.</p>
<p>This is only one of the reasons I will come back to New York exclusively to celebrate my upcoming 30th birthday next year. You read it here first &#8211;save the date&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Austin: The Future</strong></p>
<p>The last thing I thought when I met someone from <strong>Dell</strong>&#8216;s User Experience Team at <a title="Interaction 11 (Vimeo)" href="http://vimeo.com/9395674" target="_blank">Interaction 11</a> in Boulder, CO. was that I was going to end up working at such a well renowned tech company, let alone moving to Texas for it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-748" title="A snapshot of Austin during my last visit." src="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/photo-30-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></p>
<p>Roughly 4 months after my first interaction with Dell, 2 visits to the capital of Texas and many conversations, I accepted an offer to join Dell&#8217;s <a title="Dell Enterprise (web site)" href="http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/large-enterprise.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=biz&amp;~ck=mn" target="_blank">Enterprise</a> UX team.</p>
<p>Right now is an exciting time to join this team. The new work being done at Dell on the enterprise front is at its nascent stages, but indeed poised to be one that will lead the way on this very important side of the industry. To me, it&#8217;s also a challenge in a sector that I would not have originally considered working in before (e.g. something not strictly &#8220;consumer facing&#8221;). I shall indeed expand my professional horizons even more now with this new opportunity.</p>
<p>I feel like <a title="Steven: The Dell Dude" href="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/delldude.jpg" rel="lightbox[741]">someone</a> should be saying: &#8220;<em><a title="&quot;Dude...&quot; (YouTube)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BsWijdM0W0#t=00m53s" target="_blank">Dude</a>, you&#8217;re working at Dell&#8230;</em>&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to begin this new chapter in the always exciting UX/IxD world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t eat BBQ, but I do love the sauce&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>From New York to Austin; the capital of the world to the deep American south; the cold to mild winters, and the hot to REALLY hot summers, moving to Austin should be nothing less than one more amazing and enriching experience.</p>
<p>As silly as it may sound, I feel like a <a title="Addison Montgomery" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Montgomery" target="_blank">character</a> of a TV programme who gets his own spin-off series in a totally different location, practicing the same profession but meeting an entirely new group of people in a different environment.</p>
<p>Leaving a city like New York it&#8217;s not easy &#8211;specially after only half a year. I thought long and hard before making this decision. I consulted with a great number of close friends here and all over the world before making this decision&#8230;</p>
<p>Moving is no small task.</p>
<p>There was a point (right before making my decision) in which everything appeared to be lining up for me to stay in New York  &#8211;but a number things took place in such a way that &#8220;the path paved itself&#8221; for me to choose Austin, as one of my good friends recently pointed out to me.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in things being predetermined or &#8220;meant to be&#8221;, but I can see how this path came to be&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://uxmag.com/design/paper-in-screen-prototyping"><img class="size-full wp-image-722 aligncenter" src="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-12-at-1.53.26-PM.png" alt="" width="257" height="67" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is a true honour to finally be part of the long &amp; brilliant list of contributor to <a title="UX Magazine Web Site" href="http://uxmag.com/" target="_blank">UX Magazine</a>: an online publication focused on highlighting numerous topics from various fields &#8211;all revolving around the field of User Experience Design.</p>
<p><a title="&quot;Paper in Screen&quot; Prototyping on UX Magazine" href="http://uxmag.com/design/paper-in-screen-prototyping" target="_blank">The UX Mag article</a> is based on the mixed-fidelity prototyping technique I developed as part of my HCI Masters thesis at Indiana University: <a title="Read about &quot;Paper in Screen&quot; Prototyping on my Portfolio" href="http://www.diegopulido.com/portfolio/paper-in-screen-prototyping/">&#8220;Paper in Screen&#8221; Prototyping</a>.</p>
<p>I say it was was &#8220;a long time coming&#8221; because this article was meant to be published a couple of months ago, but moving to NYC, starting a new job and going to a few UX/IxD conferences <a title="IxDA's Interaction 11 conference web site" href="http://interaction.ixda.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Midwest UX web site" href="http://midwestux.com/" target="_blank">there</a> certainly delayed its release.</p>
<p>Back when <a title="Davide Bolchini's IUPUI Personal Page" href="http://mypage.iu.edu/~dbolchin/" target="_blank">Dr. Davide Bolchini</a>, <a title="Dr. Anthony Faiola's IUPUI page" href="http://newsroom.informatics.iupui.edu/directory/afaiola" target="_blank">Dr. Anthony Faiola</a> and I had our &#8220;Paper in Screen&#8221; Prototyping article published in ACM&#8217;s <a title="&quot;Paper in Screen&quot; prototyping in ACM's Interactions Magazine" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1551992&amp;CFID=17684345&amp;CFTOKEN=50543296" target="_blank">Interactions Magazine</a>, we had just proposed the idea behind the technique. The new approach to (mobile) prototyping was made by practitioners, for practitioners. It even offers the the steps to implement the technique, but it was lacking any of the testing results or conclusions I gathered once I completed my graduate thesis.</p>
<p>UX Magazine has now given me the opportunity to share those results with the rest of the UX community. After testing the technique with practitioners and a long affinity diagramming session, it was discovered that although the newly proposed technique managed to enhance the mobile user experience of simple low-fidelity prototypes, it was slightly more difficult to achieve (when compared to high-fidelity prototypes).</p>
<p>The following graph clearly shows where &#8220;Paper in Screen&#8221; Prototyping is located when compared to low and high fidelity prototypes:</p>
<p><span id="more-721"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PIS-Diagram.png" rel="lightbox[721]"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-725" title="&quot;Paper in Screen&quot; Prototyping Diagram" src="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PIS-Diagram-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>I cordially invite you to <a title="&quot;Paper in Screen&quot; Prototyping on UX Magazine" href="http://uxmag.com/design/paper-in-screen-prototyping" target="_blank">read</a> the article and provide me with feedback on it &#8211;either here or UX Magazine&#8217;s web site directly.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, this idea came to be when I was still a graduate student at IUPUI&#8217;s School of Informatics. This is why I feel compelled to thank Dr. Bolchini and Dr. Faiola once again for being part of such a great graduate programme and having assisted me throughout my time there. It was an honour and a pleasure working with them.</p>
<p>If you are a student considering the field of <a title="HCI on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction</a> as something you&#8217;d like to pursue for your graduate degree and/or PhD., I highly recommend you explore the options <a title="IUPUI's School of Informatics Graduate Degrees" href="http://informatics.iupui.edu/degrees/" target="_blank">IUPUI&#8217;s School of Informatics</a> has to offer. Not only it has an incredible group of professors and advisors, but lately it has been expanding at an incredible rate with a growing number of publications, presentations and interesting projects &#8211;something I am extremely proud of as an alumni.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is how some locals call the city of Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>&#8220;C-bus&#8221; is also where I&#8217;ve just come from, after attending the firs-ever <a title="Midwest UX web site" href="http://midwestux.com/" target="_blank">Midwest UX</a> conference.</p>
<p>It was a great, very-well organized &amp; executed conference in the User Experience Design field. The first primarily made by and for people of the Midwest of the US.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really glad to have been able to attend &#8211;not only given the great <a title="MIdwest UX Programme" href="http://www.midwestuxconference.com/program/" target="_blank">line-up</a> of presenters, talks and workshops but also because I do know (for a fact) that I got the second-to-last ticket before it sold out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to expand on my experience during Midwest UX, but for now, I&#8217;leave you with this Hellenic monument we (<a title="Brad Nunnally's web site" href="http://bradsramblings.com/" target="_blank">Brad Nunnally</a>, <a title="David Farkas' web site" href="http://brainfarks.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">David Farkas</a>, <a title="Jake Truemper's Twitter page" href="http://twitter.com/trump29" target="_blank">Jake Truemper</a> &amp; I) found on our way to the first day of the conference.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another February. Another <a title="Interaction 11" href="http://www.ixda.org/interaction/index.html" target="_blank">Interaction</a> conference that came and went.</p>
<p>I was very lucky to be able to experience my second Interaction conference, held this time in beautiful Boulder, Colorado (US)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be writing about my experiences at this enlightening conference soon. For now, I leave you with this beautiful shot I took with my iPhone, from my room at the <a title="St. Julien Hotel" href="http://www.stjulien.com/" target="_blank">St.Julien Hotel</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-706" src="http://www.diegopulido.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/photo-5-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: An iPad-related calamity has made me lost ALL the notes I had taken with the <a title="Notes Pius iPad app" href="http://notesplusapp.com/" target="_blank">Notes Plus</a> iPad application during the conference!</p>
<p>I love the app &amp; will be reviewing it sometime soon on <a title="TaskFlo.ws" href="http://taskflo.ws" target="_blank">Taskflo.ws</a>. Unfortunately, this had something to do with my MacBookPro&#8217;s mother board + hard drive failing and updating my iPad to the latest iOS version without backing up the latest contents first.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to make a personal collection of memories &amp; experiences during this great event, but it may be lighter in content than I originally intended. My notes to make it more interesting are gone.</p>
<p>Why I didn&#8217;t back up my notes on <a title="Evernote" href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> <em>during</em> the conference,I don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>Lesson learned.</p>
