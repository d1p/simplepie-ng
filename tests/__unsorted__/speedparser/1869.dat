    &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;Who knew it&amp;#39;d be so difficult to post during the summer when I have no schoolwork?&lt;br /&gt;Here I am again blogging because I&amp;#39;m worried about the amount of homework in my future that will probably distract me from making another post for a while. &amp;nbsp;I type this as I wait for my newly-dyed hair to dry. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s burgundy! &amp;nbsp;That&amp;#39;s what the package said anyway but you never know. &amp;nbsp;I just hope it looks good. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to try something new instead of black although technically I&amp;#39;ve only dyed my hair black once. &amp;nbsp;The other times it was super dark brown and purple-y black which I would do again if it wasn&amp;#39;t just purple under a lot of light. &amp;nbsp;This time I was going for something slightly unnatural but still dark. &amp;nbsp;I hope I got it right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/067_lovestory405.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working at a sushi restautant. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s the only place that hired me but I&amp;#39;m not complaining because the pay is good, the people are nice, and I get to eat the leftovers if I work the night shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to a couple other shows. &amp;nbsp;There was the one awesome weekend that I spent in mostly Brooklyn. &amp;nbsp;I saw Sufjan Stevens on that Wednesday night. &amp;nbsp;It was totally worth standing out in the pouring rain and running around lost for probably 2 hours. &amp;nbsp;The next day Ariel, her friend Gwen and I went to The Cloisters and later in the day I got to see Robbie&amp;#39;s apartment and have dinner with my aunt. &amp;nbsp;Friday I went to Williamsburg by myself and saw them setting up the most recent exhibit at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecottoncandymachine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Cotton Candy Machine&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I met Jeremyville and he was super cool. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;m hoping to have an internship there next summer or maybe over winter break. &amp;nbsp;Since then I&amp;#39;ve had art on my mind a lot. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#39;d consider my trip to the store an inspiring experience because I&amp;#39;ve been more okay with having a career in art recently.&lt;br /&gt;I also picked up this signed lithograph by Tara McPherson and have been on the hunt for a frame. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s unbelievably hard to find one because it&amp;#39;s a square. &amp;nbsp;All the cheap frames I could find were made for photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lph2he4nA51qfq1uoo1_500.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border-top-width: 4px; border-right-width: 4px; border-bottom-width: 4px; border-left-width: 4px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; width: 450px; height: 338px; &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;I want to bring that to school but I think I&amp;#39;ll leave my recently framed/signed Fillerbunny comic at home. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s hard to decide which things to leave in my room at home and which to bring to school. &amp;nbsp;Another thing I need to frame is my signed Sufjan Stevens CD that came with my ticket. &amp;nbsp;Target carries a frame especially for that but they don&amp;#39;t have it online and it&amp;#39;s only in a few stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for now. &amp;nbsp;I am going out to get frozen yogurt. I hope everyone has had a great summer. &amp;lt;3&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

  <title>Summer Mood</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/9151.html</link>
  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/1692t85.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer vacation hasn&apos;t been as bad as last summer&apos;s. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s kind of boring and awful because I can&apos;t find a job after contacting what is now probably over 20 places. &amp;nbsp;But I work as an intern at a local hospital in the histology lab from 9-1 on every week day. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ve seen a lot of gross things but it&apos;s really cool. &amp;nbsp;Some cool things have been mixed in with the boring parts of summer so far. &amp;nbsp;So here is a catch-up post to prove that fun things have actually been happening in my life, believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The first exciting thing was BOMBfest. &amp;nbsp;Ingrid and I drove to Connecticut and stayed at Kaitlin&apos;s house with Allison for the weekend. &amp;nbsp;I laughed more that weekend than I have all year. &amp;nbsp;I got to see so many good artists and it was really nice because the money from the tickets all went to charity. &amp;nbsp;Music festivals seem really expensive but if you calculate it out and think about how much it&apos;d cost to see those artist individually, you end up saving a lot of money. &amp;nbsp;I took a couple good photos and I got to talk to Bethany from Best Coast again. &amp;nbsp;I regret not talking to Ali because she&apos;s such a sweetheart but I didn&apos;t want to bother her while she was watching Woods. &amp;nbsp;Anyway here is the grand total list of who I saw that weekend: Dan Deacon, Neon Trees, Holy Fuck, The New Pornographers (but Neko Case wasn&apos;t there?), Woods, Weezer, Best Coast, The Shpongletron Experience (which was INCREDIBLE!), Wavves, Man Man, Nosaj Thing, Portugal, The Man, Small Black, and a few brief seconds of HEALTH. &amp;nbsp;It was horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/248079_1419988423183_1336830831_31270101_1106516_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are Allison, Kaitlin, Ingrid and me at Woods&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;267&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/249449_1419987423158_1336830831_31270095_7493433_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See if you can find Dan Deacon in that crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;green eyes~ by Câˆ†RLY., on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/hellocarly/5776831108/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;green eyes~&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2635/5776831108_c4b477bd44.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan Williams from Wavves being beautiful as usual&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/f58.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also gone to see Fleet Foxes a week or two before that and it was also incredible. &amp;nbsp;Lauren and her friend bought their tickets together and I paid for mine separately so I had a seat a little bit away from them. &amp;nbsp;I was worried that I&apos;d get stuck next to some unchill middleaged couple but I happen to get a seat right next to a girl from school. &amp;nbsp;So weird but it was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Last weekend was spent in NYC with Emily who I haven&apos;t seen since she came to visit MD and see Yeasayer...and I think that was last spring? &amp;nbsp;We went to the Met and MoMA and ate at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smacnyc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; excellent mac and cheese only restaurant. &amp;nbsp;The biggest highlight was seeing Yeasayer and Smith Westerns on Saturday night. &amp;nbsp;And I just so happen to be seeing Smith Westerns again this weekend for free!&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I had more to say when I started this but I guess not. &amp;nbsp;Maybe I just know how to condense it into a short post. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/0004fgx1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hey hi what&apos;s up. &amp;nbsp;I have been neglecting this blog... clearly.&lt;br /&gt;I changed my layout... again but I think I like it the most. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ve said that before.&lt;br /&gt;School is almost over which is excellent except it means I have to go home and I don&apos;t have that many friends there. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m working on seeing a bunch of shows but that requires a job, something I do not yet posses. &amp;nbsp;I already have tickets to see Yeasayer with Smith Westerns and Fleet Foxes. &amp;nbsp;I saw Wye Oak recently in a really cute venue in Baltimore. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s in a&amp;nbsp;dilapidated&amp;nbsp;church and it&apos;s so pretty! They sold cheap vegan desserts in the back. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;d love to see another show there. &amp;nbsp;Wye Oak was fantastic. &amp;nbsp;Jenn&apos;s voice is incredible, as is their new album. &amp;nbsp;Check them out if you like Beach House. &amp;nbsp;I tried concert photography again because it was one of those really relaxed venues that had no camera policy. &amp;nbsp;I got some good photos and I even took some good ones on film.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Wye Oak by Câˆ†RLY., on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/hellocarly/5628719870/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; alt=&quot;Wye Oak&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5628719870_eb1805699c.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIG was not as much fun this year because it was indoors due to rain. :( But I got to meet Bethany from Best Coast and I nearly had a heart attack. &amp;nbsp;She is so sweet and I wish I got to talk to Ali and Bobb as well. &amp;nbsp;I think Ali is also a sweetheart. &amp;nbsp;I wish I could have gotten to spend time with them the rest of the evening because they stayed in the hotel right next to my school and went to The Cheesecake Factory. hah That would have completed my day. &amp;nbsp;I still had a lot of fun and look forward to seeing them perform live in the future. &amp;nbsp;I stupidly didn&apos;t get a photo with Bethany but I have the following two photo. &amp;nbsp;I took tons more but the lighting was bad and I just have my default lens. I do what I can.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;bethany cosentino//best coast by Câˆ†RLY., on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/hellocarly/5604214594/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; alt=&quot;bethany cosentino//best coast&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5604214594_185fd4e796.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also signed this paper for me and I need to get a frame for it! &amp;nbsp;Note to self: Get it at Michaels with Cait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn3.dailybooth.com/14/pictures/large/36014817de7870f40a9d82796eee75a6_14809503.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;School is ending shortly so I have to focus on a lot of work-y things. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m hoping to get a pathology internship at a local hospital and a job at the Disney Store this summer. &amp;nbsp;That would be absolutely ideal. &amp;nbsp;I have to finish my dumb resume to email that asap since they haven&apos;t called me after they asked for my number.</description>

  <title>New Year etc.</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/8544.html</link>
  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/img_1473589_54952264_22.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hello LJ~* &amp;nbsp;I haven&apos;t posted in forever and it has been on my mind for the past week or so. &amp;nbsp;I waited a little while so I would have enough material to write about to make a decent post. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m still discontent with my background on here and I don&apos;t really have other options. &amp;nbsp;I would just like something cute that isn&apos;t white so I can see the boxes around the posts and things clearly. &amp;nbsp;Hm... this looks alright for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/pixels/854460s8ejngoy7s.gif&quot; /&gt;I got my grades and I did really well with all my courses. &amp;nbsp;Math went a little worse than predicted but I still ended up with 4 As, I think and 1 A- and... math was somewhere in the B range. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m getting a little worried about next semester with chemistry but I don&apos;t have to take lab so I hope it will be more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Winter break has been generally boring. &amp;nbsp;Christmas wasn&apos;t too boring though; I was barely on the computer and that&apos;s a sign of a good day. &amp;nbsp;We went to a Turkish restaurant in Brooklyn with my aunt and uncle. &amp;nbsp;Then Ariel came over and I think that was the day we watched The Illusionist. &amp;nbsp;I have watched a few movies with Ariel and I loved what we watched! &amp;nbsp;We saw Kill Bill 1 &amp;amp; 2 also. &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t know what took me so long to watch them and I highly recommend them both. &amp;nbsp;I have been waiting for some earring parts that I ordered to come in the mail so I can finish making some origami star earrings to sell. &amp;nbsp;My dad got this Apple TV thing from his coworker as a holiday gift and he got Netflix so I have instant watch on the tv! &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s so exciting. &amp;nbsp;I rewatched 3 episodes of Skins today. &amp;nbsp;Now it&apos;s time for show and tell!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/2008062203111425.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/LJ/61dce6838e4e9fdcf6f443587540d412.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this cup on sale at The Disney Store. &amp;nbsp;I can make it look more mature by taking the top off of it. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s a good addition to my kitchenware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I went to Mitsuwa, which is a huge Japanese grocery store with a food court. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s probably my favourite place around here. &amp;nbsp;Here is what I had for lunch:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/LJ/1b2cfdc252ebc147aa7873a1dcd49636.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;There is another store near there that sells a lot of Japanese toys and other merchandise and I found this really cute masterball keychain. &amp;nbsp;I remember these were around years ago but I don&apos;t think I ever had one so I had to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/LJ/1e01b02076f2f2ea48f12229e9c9a959.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/LJ/54a7ee949cb1fe7bce7ddde00ae91de7.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/2008062203111425.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I decided to make a list of my favourite things/discoveries from 2010.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cosmetics: Aveeno Clear Complexion facewash (my face is clearer than ever, a good investment), liquid eyeliner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nikon D3100&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Albums: The Suburbs/Arcade Fire, King of the Beach/Wavves, Crazy For You/Best Coast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food things: Aroma Expresso Bar, peppermint mochas, rootbeer floats, Haribo Sour Spaghetti&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Website/blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/altreport&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.hipsterrunoff.com/altreport&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snacksandshit.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.snacksandshit.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Games: Kingdom Heart 358/2, Pokemon TCG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/2008062203111425.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;I actually have real New Year plans for once! &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m going into the city to Ariel&apos;s dad&apos;s restaurant which is located in Times Square, I think or near it and there&apos;s going to be a lot of food and it&apos;s going to be really fancy. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m leaving for my Israel birthright trip the next day at midnight so I&apos;ll be gone and internetless for 10 whole days! &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m kind of worried for myself. &amp;nbsp;We aren&apos;t allowed to bring computers so I&apos;m hoping I&apos;ll have a chance to hop on a computer at an internet cafe. &amp;nbsp;I like having time away from the computer but there are some of my friends that I like to be in contact with fairly often so it might be a little rough. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully I&apos;ll be pretty well-occupied. &amp;nbsp;I have a huge bunch of books to read in the future. &amp;nbsp;I just bought &amp;quot;Haunted&amp;quot; by Chuck Palaniuk and I&apos;m excited to read that. &amp;nbsp;Frank also brought a few books over to let me borrow today so I have a lot on my plate. &amp;nbsp;I made this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4717259&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; account. &amp;nbsp;You should add me if you have one! &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ll probably be too tired to read on the plane so I&apos;ll just sit and stare off into space or play DS because I can never sleep sitting up.&lt;/div&gt;Other things...

  <title>Pokemon + Halloween Weekend</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/8176.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/pixels/2wohsmw.gif&quot; /&gt;This week was a little bit on the boring side. &amp;nbsp;I didn&apos;t do much of anything during the week and it was kind of gross and rainy for most of it. &amp;nbsp;I finished my sculpture project early so that was a big relief. &amp;nbsp;I have been trying to keep myself busy. &amp;nbsp;On Monday I had a good two games of Pokemon against Steven but I lost both times. &amp;nbsp;The second time he used a trainer card to make me draw cards and then killed me immediately after. &amp;nbsp;That was just mean! &amp;nbsp;I also went to two music department concerts. &amp;nbsp;One was an Irish flute concert which I had to write about for the school paper. &amp;nbsp;That was pretty good and now I want to learn to play Irish flute. &amp;nbsp;Then I went to this baroque and classical ensemble performance that I have to write about for my music class. &amp;nbsp;That&apos;s going to be difficult and I&apos;m not looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butttt... this weekend was so busy! &amp;nbsp;On Friday I went to the mall with Missy, Molly and Shannon. &amp;nbsp;Forever 21 and Delia*s, two of my favorite stores, are hiring! &amp;nbsp;So I&apos;m applying to them both even though I work in the theatre now. &amp;nbsp;I can only work there for 10 hours a week and it&apos;s for minimum wage so maybe I can make more elsewhere. &amp;nbsp;I could also just transfer to locations closer to my house over the summer and just get general retail experience. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s a little annoying to walk there but the discounts and money I make will hopefully compensate. &amp;nbsp;We mostly just went to get finishing touches to our Halloween costumes. &amp;nbsp;Shannon got a costume to wear to Rocky Horror, Molly got a tutu, Missy got red stockings and I got white tights. &amp;nbsp;I made sure to get cute decorative ones so that I will wear them again in the future. &amp;nbsp;We also stopped in the Toys R Us there because I wanted to buy a deck of Pokemon cards that are okay to play in league. &amp;nbsp;I ended up spending $20 on cards. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/86dcce5e4798047c62bbf17c42e28847.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I bought the Espeon deck plus a booster pack. &amp;nbsp;No big deal... I can just make more money in the future and I won&apos;t end up broke, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn1.dailybooth.com/4/pictures/large/ca00996911054cfa1a38bc81df368e68_9699714.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ready for battle~*&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;That was Friday. &amp;nbsp;Saturday we woke up super early to go to Rally to Restore Sanity! &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/tumblr_l4wkmyH5yO1qb5zli.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It wasn&apos;t that bad getting there but the Metro was a little bit congested. &amp;nbsp;It was &lt;strong&gt;SO CROWDED&lt;/strong&gt; when we got there. &amp;nbsp;We were in the area in front of the stage but we were nowhere near close to the front. &amp;nbsp;I couldn&apos;t even see the screens for most of the time because of all the tall people in front of me. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/281sus-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I always wish that there was a designated section for people below a certain height so that I can see. &amp;nbsp;It was really cool to read everyone&apos;s signs and be around so many people. &amp;nbsp;It was definitely worth the trip but my feet hurt so much afterward. &amp;nbsp;The metro was so overcrowded on the way back and it took us so long to get on a train. &amp;nbsp;I have some photos Missy took at the Rally behind the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs446.ash2/71975_10150305879595072_651040071_15562962_8241202_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me, Molly and Evan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs983.snc4/75606_10150305881770072_651040071_15563042_6223960_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missy, Cleo, Evan, Me and Molly with Cleo&apos;s parents on the steps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs973.snc4/76678_10150305890910072_651040071_15563420_6481365_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal favorite sign&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs470.ash2/74300_10150305891945072_651040071_15563461_6160503_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*THIS* many people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lb6m7o6T5L1qzegzso1_400.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was Hello Kitty for Halloween, in case you couldn&apos;t tell. &amp;nbsp;I just painted my face and wore this hoodie over my red and white H&amp;amp;M dress with white tights. &amp;nbsp;It looked a lot better than I expected. &amp;nbsp;I did no Halloween related things today. &amp;nbsp;Instead, yesterday was extra long and we went to Rocky Horror at school. &amp;nbsp;It was much more fun this year because I was more familiar with it and caught on to the stuff people yell. &amp;nbsp;I might go again next weekend; it&apos;s going to be superhero costume themed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs492.ash2/76577_10150305897490072_651040071_15563677_5441641_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will leave you with this awesomely blurry photo of Molly, me, Miriam and Missy at Rocky Horror last night. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m going to go get a really late dinner, take a shower and finish up my art homework that&apos;s due tomorrow night. &amp;nbsp;I know I&apos;m not going to want to do it tomorrow. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ll check out Scott Pilgrim from the library before I leave because they finally found the book. &amp;nbsp;I can read that tomorrow. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ll post again soon and hopefully have some of my own pictures because I borrowed Missy&apos;s camera charger.</description>

  <title>Hey hello again.</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/7904.html</link>
  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/tumblr_l8t29pBrNM1qa910oo1_400.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still alive! &amp;nbsp;My gosh it has been a long time. &amp;nbsp;School is so emotionally draining. &amp;nbsp;Here I am again trying to remember all the things that happened since the last entry. &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t know where my camera charger is so I have not been taking many photos. &amp;nbsp;I think it&apos;s still at home somewhere but no one can find it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/281sus-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I hope I get&amp;nbsp;a hold&amp;nbsp;of it soon. &amp;nbsp;On the subject of photos, I can&apos;t wait to get my roll of film developed. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m not even so devastated that I can&apos;t use my point and shoot because I love my Minolta too much. &amp;nbsp;I took some more photos with it yesterday. &amp;nbsp;It was so lovely outside so I studied at a picnic table on the quad. &amp;nbsp;Eventually I had a whole group of people sitting with me. &amp;nbsp;Molly came and played her banjo and Max came and played it too. &amp;nbsp;He&apos;s such a pro. &amp;nbsp;Missy was sitting with us as well and then Cleo, Miriam, and Dustin came and joined us. &amp;nbsp;Then they all climbed into a tree. &amp;nbsp;I wish I could have taken photos of that, but the sun was directly behind them and it was setting so the lighting was not idea. &amp;nbsp;On the brighter side, I met this kid Ben who uses a Nikkormat and said he could teach me how to use mine if I bring it. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m so excited because it&apos;s a really good camera and my dad has all these ridiculous lenses and accessories for it that would be so wasted if I never learned to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/2008062203111425.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erm exciting things... &amp;nbsp;I went to Virgin Freefest! &amp;nbsp;It was such a fun day and perfect weather. &amp;nbsp;Actually, it was a bit hot but it was cool in the shade so that was okay. &amp;nbsp;It was incredible for a free show. &amp;nbsp;I got to see Yeasayer, Matt &amp;amp; Kim, Joan Jett, LCD Soundsystem, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Pavement and Sleigh Bells. &amp;nbsp;I wasn&apos;t disappointed by any of them. &amp;nbsp;I wish I could have seen MIA but I would have lost my seats at LCD Soundsystem. &amp;nbsp;MIA goes to almost every festival anyway so it&apos;s okay. &amp;nbsp;Please observe an excited Jenna and me carefully examining the set times~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs324.ash2/60465_469186750638_745115638_7197749_3441376_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/2008062203111425.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;I wish I had more photos to post. &amp;nbsp;This is upsetting me. &amp;nbsp;Oh so I finally learned to play Pokemon TCG last night! &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s surprisingly easy and a lot easier to learn if someone is teaching you. &amp;nbsp;I went to Jack&apos;s apartment and played with him, Mo and Steven. &amp;nbsp;I won 3 rounds or something so I&apos;m pretty good for a noob. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/adcd25fb.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We just played with a fire, electric and water deck that Jack and Steven made from Steven&apos;s cards. &amp;nbsp;I wish I had my cards still but I gave them to my brother and he refuses to give them back. &amp;nbsp;I suppose I should just buy a new deck. &amp;nbsp;There are so many options though. &amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&apos;ljuser ljuser-name_starpowerrr&apos; lj:user=&apos;starpowerrr&apos; style=&apos;white-space:nowrap;text-decoration:line-through&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://starpowerrr.livejournal.com/profile&apos;&gt;&lt;img src=&apos;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=3&apos; alt=&apos;[info]&apos; width=&apos;17&apos; height=&apos;17&apos; style=&apos;vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;&apos;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://starpowerrr.livejournal.com/&apos;&gt;&lt;b&gt;starpowerrr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;recommended a few to me that I plan to look into since she knows what&apos;s up in the world of Pokemon TCG.&lt;br /&gt;Also I finally got a job at school working for the theatre department! &amp;nbsp;I have to make props for Animal Farm so far but they are going to need me to help with some set construction soon. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m pretty excited to earn money and not feel like I am on the verge of bankruptcy every time I spend a dollar. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m staying here over fall break so I can work. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s just not worth it to go home.&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I am going to see Jane Goodall speak at my school! &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t know that much about her work but she&apos;s a really incredible person so I can&apos;t wait to hear what she has to say. &amp;nbsp;I suppose that&apos;s it for this post. &amp;nbsp;I hope everyone is having a good October!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/decootomedojo1289.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carly&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>School update</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/7516.html</link>
  <description>&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/litepinkbow.gif&quot; /&gt;This is my first post since I have been back at school. &amp;nbsp;Yay or something. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s been so long that I really have to think about what I need to blog about. &amp;nbsp;That&apos;s kind of lame. &amp;nbsp;The first day of school was a joke because my one class was cancelled so Cait and I went to Wegman&apos;s and the state fair. &amp;nbsp;Needless to say, it was a good first day of classes.&lt;br /&gt;School has been pretty good otherwise. &amp;nbsp;I feel so free without having to take 3 hour labs. &amp;nbsp;My anthropology class is kind of a joke. &amp;nbsp;Math is going to be really good. &amp;nbsp;I was worried about it but my professor is really cool so I&apos;m not worried. &amp;nbsp;My 3D art class is kind of hard just because I&apos;m not used to doing art like that. &amp;nbsp;My digital imaging class met for the first time last night. &amp;nbsp;Cait and I should not be allowed in the same class... especially if there are computers. &amp;nbsp;We are a little overqualified for it so we goofed off all period.&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;Alex came to visit me this weekend. &amp;nbsp;It was pretty eventful. &amp;nbsp;Friday night I went to a fancy cocktail party in Chiara and Heather&apos;s room. &amp;nbsp;It was a lot of fun. &amp;nbsp;Saturday night was really interesting but I won&apos;t go into detail. &amp;nbsp;Then on Sunday Alex and I went out to lunch with her friend who goes to UMBC. &amp;nbsp;He treated us to Red Robin which was really really nice of him to do. &amp;nbsp;We then came back and did homework and watched Saved before heading out to see Panda Bear at Ottobar. &amp;nbsp;We got super lost on the way there and accidentally ended up going the wrong way on a one-way street. &amp;nbsp;Whoops... We got there and got parking and it was all good. &amp;nbsp;DJ Dog Dick was weird but Prince Rama was incredible. &amp;nbsp;I really should have bought their album there. &amp;nbsp;Deakin was nice too but Panda Bear was just awesome. &amp;nbsp;The album tracks don&apos;t do him justice. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s much better when you experience his music firsthand because it&apos;s not like you are just listening to it; you can really feel it. &amp;nbsp;I also bought Oddsac (Animal Collective&apos;s visual album) because I was really slacking on that preorder and knew I&apos;d end up ordering it and paying for shipping if I didn&apos;t just buy it then. &amp;nbsp;I really like going to shows and the people that go to shows at Ottobar are always really interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/l.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I think I have finally perfected my makeup routine. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s so simple and I just don&apos;t bother with eyeshadow anymore unless it&apos;s a special&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/pixels/PinkWhale.gif?t=1284499557&quot; /&gt; occasion. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m just too lazy to pick it out every day. &amp;nbsp;So I just do concealer where needed (no longer on my forehead because my bangs cover it and I just put clindamycin there instead),&amp;nbsp;liquid black eyeliner on top, black pencil on waterline outside corner halfway in, purple pencil onthe bottom, a little blush and mascara. &amp;nbsp;I just bought the purple pencil from Sephora the other day because it was $8 which is what I pay for my CVS brand anyway and I don&apos;t think CVS carries a purple pencil like that. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s also the retractable twisty kind with a sponge tip and sharpener. &amp;nbsp;I consider that a good deal. &amp;nbsp;I might go and get some other colors... possibly the glittery purple.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/l.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Oh also I don&apos;t care if you don&apos;t listen to Arcade Fire. &amp;nbsp;You should still watch this interactive music video because it&apos;s so cool! www.thewildernessdowntown.com &amp;nbsp;Caroline and I are collaborating on an album review for the school paper.&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m sorry this entry lacked in photos, but I think I left my camera charger at home and it&apos;s not out of battery power yet, but I&apos;ve been hesitant to use it. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully I&apos;ll have a more visually appealing post soon.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>Under Construction</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/7073.html</link>

&amp;nbsp;I always wear through my converse both where my heel is inside and on the bottoms so it was time for new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;416&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/b94ff8703a9bb4f3bc201e616875ef31_7589026.jpg?t=1282855568&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;I also got this Toy Story notebook for school. &amp;nbsp;The shirt I&apos;m wearing is new too. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s from Madonna&apos;s clothing line which I thought might be weird but some of the stuff (such as this shirt) is really cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;416&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/ecb7fe349f246746ee5f5ffb3673207c_7590905.jpg?t=1282855568&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the grocery store with my sister last night and was pleasantly surprised by the little Care Bear toys in the quarter machine. &amp;nbsp;I bought one for her and one for myself. &amp;nbsp;They&apos;re so cute! &amp;nbsp;I want to spend all my quarters on them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/th_o0020002010518195939.gif?t=1282855933&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;422&quot; height=&quot;43&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/11340018.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. The World with Anisha on Tuesday. &amp;nbsp;I haven&apos;t been to the movies in a while. &amp;nbsp;I think the last thing I saw was Toy Story 3. &amp;nbsp;The movie was really good. &amp;nbsp;I didn&apos;t know what to expect because I didn&apos;t even see a preview for it. &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t watch TV a lot so I&apos;m kind of oblivious and I end up having no expectations when I go to see movies. &amp;nbsp;I guess that&apos;s kind of nice so I&apos;m not really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School is starting soon. &amp;nbsp;I go back on Sunday. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m really excited to be back in Baltimore. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s so much more exciting to be there. &amp;nbsp;I have a suite the same way I did last year with the same room/suitemates. &amp;nbsp;We all got along really well so we figured it was better to keep it the same then risk living with other people. &amp;nbsp;It works out really nicely because we all have our&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;groups of friends and are friendly with each other so we&apos;re not together all the time. &amp;nbsp;I haven&apos;t really done much packing yet, but most of my winter clothes are in the same place in the basement in an under the bed storage kind of thing. &amp;nbsp;That makes my life easier. &amp;nbsp;I still have to go through and pick out the things I don&apos;t need to bring with me. &amp;nbsp;Now I know what clothes I wear a lot and which ones I shouldn&apos;t even bother to bring with me.&lt;br /&gt;I did something silly and bought the new Wavves and Arcade Fire albums with a Target gift card that I found in my room. &amp;nbsp;I had them shipped to my school address so they will be waiting for me when I get there. :)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;422&quot; height=&quot;37&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/11340020.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>Making this short</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/6482.html</link>
  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/th_h385.gif?t=1282018712&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&quot;&gt;I have been incredibly jetlagged since I have gotten back. &amp;nbsp;The plane back was a red eye flight that was 12 hours long. &amp;nbsp;I can&apos;t sleep on airplanes if my life depended on it so it was just a lethal combination. &amp;nbsp;The trip was really great and I can&apos;t wait to go back on birthright!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&apos;t done much of anything since I&apos;ve been home. &amp;nbsp;I wake up at 8 every morning because of jet lag. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s pretty awful. &amp;nbsp;The one exciting thing I did was go to the NY Renaissance Faire. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s my only summer tradition and I usually go more than once. &amp;nbsp;I might end up going with different people this Saturday. &amp;nbsp;That is my costume below. &amp;nbsp;I just got that jingly belt in Israel because they&apos;re way overpriced here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/145583579.jpg?t=1282019305&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I haven&apos;t really done much else since vacation ended. &amp;nbsp;I feel like I haven&apos;t really lived summer to its fullest and that I should be out doing crazy things because I am in my prime... or something. &amp;nbsp;I have to do some things before I go to school such as redo my entire schedule and go to the doctor and dentist. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m not particularly looking forward to any of that. &amp;nbsp;After a lot of stress, I decided to switch my major with my minor; now I am an art major and biology minor. &amp;nbsp;I think it has me taking one less chemistry course. &amp;nbsp;With my art major I want to design band merch like posters and t-shirts and album art. &amp;nbsp;So much for forensic science... &amp;nbsp;Anyway, I found my Japanese Coca Cola shirt that has been MIA for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot;

  <title>Update from Israel!</title>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/img_1486568_22574616_0.png?t=1280937369&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;The plane ride was such a pain. &amp;nbsp;I never went on a plane ride that was so long and I also can never sleep on planes so it was a lethal combination. &amp;nbsp;Luckily there are movies and a live map thing of where the plane is, which was pretty cool. &amp;nbsp;The first flight was about 7 hours to London. &amp;nbsp;London was cool, but we were only in the airport for 2 hours and it was 6:00 am London time so it wasn&apos;t the best situation. &amp;nbsp;For an English speaking country, a lot of what I saw was really different from America. &amp;nbsp;I would definitely want to go back and spend more time in the UK. &amp;nbsp;The second flight was about 4 hours. &amp;nbsp;I tried falling asleep and nearly did it for a while. &amp;nbsp;The flight was kind of a hassle but it was very much worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/9__MTAyNDkyXzIw-1.gif?&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/9__MTAyNDkyXzIw-1.gif?&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do more here in a day than I do in a week at home; that&apos;s not even an exaggeration; it&apos;s an unfortunate truth. &amp;nbsp;We stayed in Tel Aviv for what I think was 3 nights. &amp;nbsp;So far we saw a lot of ruins of old cities from when the Romans occupied the area. &amp;nbsp;There are ruins everywhere and so much of it is still being excavated. &amp;nbsp;We even did an archaeological dig in an old city. &amp;nbsp;After that, we got to crawl through a partially excavated cave that was candle lit. &amp;nbsp;I think it was over 100 outside that day but the temperature underground was so much cooler. &amp;nbsp;We also got to see an old city called Caesarea yesterday. &amp;nbsp;Even some of the mosaic areas near the bath house were preserved. &amp;nbsp;We saw more mosaics today. &amp;nbsp;For the next two nights we are staying at this horse ranch in the middle of nowhere. &amp;nbsp;We can hear the soldiers practicing at the nearby military base. &amp;nbsp;I also rode a horse today!&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;ll just put some photos behind a cut and explain some things below them. &amp;nbsp;My brother and dad have more photos on their cameras but they aren&apos;t online yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs089.ash2/37813_1232724741708_1336830831_31012143_1189500_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London airport&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs117.ash2/39166_1233438559553_1336830831_31015869_8063473_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caesarea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs306.snc4/40657_1233440479601_1336830831_31015884_7708657_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caves made by the Mediterranean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs129.ash2/39798_1233440559603_1336830831_31015886_549291_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lebanon/Israel border near the caves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br type=&quot;_moz&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&amp;nbsp;It was a good deal. &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t think it should have been $120.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/boobeecutedotcom-i-c-line-00372.gif?t=1280346167&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize I&apos;m kind of going backwards here, but I saw Modest Mouse on Thursday with my cousin and her friends. &amp;nbsp;It was a sold out show in a fairly big venue. &amp;nbsp; We had seats though and it was kind of nice. &amp;nbsp;They&apos;re good live, but they didn&apos;t play &amp;quot;Float On&amp;quot;! &amp;nbsp; I was pretty upset about that. &amp;nbsp;That&apos;s pretty much the extent of anything exciting in my life. &amp;nbsp;I also went to Ingrid and Tessa&apos;s birthday parties. &amp;nbsp;I kind of wish I had a birthday party too, but I decided against it because I have such a random assortment of friends and thought it would be awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Okay also I am going to Israel on Friday. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m going to be there for 2 weeks so I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll be able to post any updates. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s going to be busy and a lot of fun. &amp;nbsp;I can&apos;t wait to get out of NJ.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/h447-1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/th_o0107002010616049138.gif?t=1279600872&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such a good weekend and a good start of the week. &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t really remember what I did Friday so it must not have been important.&lt;br /&gt;Saturday was my birthday though and I went to Siren music festival at Coney Island. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m so happy it was on my birthday or else I probably would have stayed home all day and done nothing. &amp;nbsp;I went with Alex, Tessa and her boyfriend Josh, who drove. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I got to see Surfer Blood, Wye Oak, Pains of Being Pure at Heart and Matt &amp;amp; Kim! &amp;nbsp;All for free too, by the way. &amp;nbsp;It was so hot and there really wasn&apos;t anywhere to go with AC which proved to be a problem. &amp;nbsp;We kept relocating to this one restaurant on the boardwalk that was big if you walked in and had couches and a couple of fans. &amp;nbsp;I got really dehydrated at one point during Surfer Blood and nearly passed out. &amp;nbsp;I tried drinking a lot of water but it wasn&apos;t enough, which was weird because I&apos;ve been outside for a long time in heat and that&apos;s never happened to me. &amp;nbsp;My stomach felt sick before I even felt dehydrated because sometimes that just happens to me on its own. &amp;nbsp;Then I got dizzy and sat down for a while and felt better. &amp;nbsp;I got up but then the feeling came back and I started to get tingly in my hands and got really afraid. &amp;nbsp;So once the set was over I tried to go back to the restaurant but I was just about to pass out because everything was going black. &amp;nbsp;Luckily as I was walking on the boardwalk I started to feel better. &amp;nbsp;Someone from style.com photographed and interviewed me too, but they didn&apos;t put me on the website in the end. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/o0057002010350900885.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was kind of disappointing but I will deal with it. &amp;nbsp;This other guy asked me for photographs too and said he would email them to me. &amp;nbsp;I wasn&apos;t the only one wearing that dress though. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ll put some photos behind a cut~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs065.snc4/34636_1228917006517_1336830831_30997824_5888633_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me &amp;amp; Alex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs097.ash2/38187_1229491140870_1336830968_30999993_1846958_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I has a corm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;409&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs197.snc4/38202_1228916886514_1336830831_30997821_6677275_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex and a Free hugs guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs025.ash2/34636_1228916806512_1336830831_30997819_2150299_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa :3&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/439872zev6untzyt.gif?t=1279603158&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I went out for sushi with Nick and Greg. &amp;nbsp;Then it started pouring like it was at was this morning at 8:30. &amp;nbsp;It was hailing tonight too. &amp;nbsp;Greg is all into weather so he got so excited about it. &amp;nbsp;So we ran out to the car in pouring rain and waited for it to stop a little. &amp;nbsp;Greg made Nick chase it for a little but then we ended up at the reservoir and hopped the fence. &amp;nbsp;We must have been there for over an hour skipping rocks and taking photos. &amp;nbsp;Then it started to rain again so we had to run fast to the car to get out of there. &amp;nbsp;They didn&apos;t have power at their houses so they came over for a few hours and it didn&apos;t go as bad as expected. &amp;nbsp;They got along with my family pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, does anyone else use Google Chrome and have trouble posting entries? &amp;nbsp;Do your LJ-cuts and stuff not work properly/when you try to backspace text it backspaces on the browser tab?! &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s really annoying and I wonder if it&apos;s just me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&apos;s all I&apos;ve got for now~&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>Maybe I&apos;m just crazy, crazy for you baby</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/5360.html</link>
  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/pixels/Lme21-1.gif&quot; /&gt;I&apos;ve been slacking on updating recently because I&apos;ve been so overwhelmed with work. &amp;nbsp;Right now I finished a practice test for my chem exam that is tomorrow and I&apos;m waiting for my friend to get back to me after comparing answers. &amp;nbsp;My teacher gives us the practice test the day before and doesn&apos;t give us the answers. &amp;nbsp;We have to go in early before class to discuss it with him. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s so frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/5-8.gif?t=1279157989&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;I have actually been doing things that aren&apos;t homework related, believe it or not. &amp;nbsp;I just need a minute to recall what these things are...&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes! &amp;nbsp;On Tuesday I went to go see She &amp;amp; Him at Terminal 5 in NYC! &amp;nbsp;They were incredible. &amp;nbsp;Zooey&apos;s voice was so much better live. &amp;nbsp;I was so impressed. &amp;nbsp;And she seems super nice too. &amp;nbsp;They did a cover of this song called &amp;quot;Put a Spell on You&amp;quot; and it&apos;s definitely something you should hear. &amp;nbsp;Zooey&apos;s voice surprised me in that and I found an mp3 of it online the next day. &amp;nbsp;They played almost every song off of both albums. &amp;nbsp;They are definitely a band worth seeing live.&lt;br /&gt;They wouldn&apos;t allow us to take any photos, not even on our phones! &amp;nbsp;I thought that was kind of weird. &amp;nbsp;Even Zooey said herself that you can take photos, just with no flash, but the people who worked there weren&apos;t having it. &amp;nbsp;I think it&apos;s because Zooey is pretty famous, but it&apos;s not really like a cell phone picture is of high enough quality to sell to anyone... &amp;nbsp;Anyway here are two relevant photos~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/tumblr_l54avcAcHW1qzegzso1_400.jpg?t=1279158461&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/tumblr_l57ybkBl1z1qzegzso1_400.jpg?t=1279158461&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luv being below drinking age blog &apos;10&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/5-8.gif?t=1279157989&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I got to see Real Estate on Saturday! &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/33kznso.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That was so exciting and such a fun night. &amp;nbsp;There were actually two shows that night that I wanted to go to. &amp;nbsp;One of them was Real Estate which was closer and later at night, and the other one was Rasputina in the city. &amp;nbsp;We ended up seeing Real Estate because it was at a better time/location. &amp;nbsp;I had seen Rasputina before anyway. &amp;nbsp;I wrote all about it a few entries back. &amp;nbsp;If you didn&apos;t already notice, I go to a lot of shows. :b&lt;br /&gt;We almost had transportation issues because Nick said he would drive and then bailed on us, so I almost didn&apos;t go. &amp;nbsp;But then Greg was super sweet to me and offered a ride from his friend who was driving him. &amp;nbsp;I felt bad accepting but he pretty much forced me to go because he knew how much I really wanted to go. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/o0020002010616049157.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ears were numb and ringing for the hour 1+ after I left the venue because we were standing right near the front and consequently right near the speakers. &amp;nbsp;I keep forgetting to bring ear plugs or something to these shows. &amp;nbsp;I won&apos;t forget when I see Modest Mouse next Thursday! &amp;nbsp;Real Estate said they were going to have a pool party at one of their houses after the show because they live locally, but we couldn&apos;t go because it was way late. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m sure it would have made for some excellent stories.&lt;br /&gt;Both She &amp;amp; Him and Real Estate were a nice change since I nearly died at Wavves. &amp;nbsp;I didn&apos;t have to worry about my live ending at these two shows. &amp;nbsp;They were very ~chill~. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m a bit worried about Modest Mouse though.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/5-8.gif?t=1279157989&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My birthday is Saturday! &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m just going to go to Siren music festival at Coney Island. &amp;nbsp;The bands I want to see are Matt &amp;amp; Kim, Surfer Blood, Harlem and Holy Fuck. &amp;nbsp;So that is what is in my future as of now. &amp;nbsp;And as I said before, I&apos;m seeing Modest Mouse Thursday with my cousin. &amp;nbsp;There is also a Best Coast show next Friday at the South Street Seaport and hopefully someone will be able to go with because I&apos;m obsessing over the new album. &amp;nbsp;Speaking of which, if you haven&apos;t downloaded the free Kid Cudi/Bethany Cosentino (Best Coast)/Rostam Batmanglij (Vampire Weekend) song from the Converse website, do it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://play.converse.com/play/show/?p=1614&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I made it easy for you. :)&lt;br /&gt;Okay yeah I think that&apos;s it for now.~*&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>One does not simply fly into Montclair!</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/5006.html</link>
  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;245&quot; height=&quot;146&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv83/cuppykate/cinnamorillrainbow-cuppykate.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;strike&gt;I decided to write this journal entry a little bit early. &amp;nbsp; Reason being, things are fresh in my mind and I don&apos;t want to forget what I intended to write but I don&apos;t think I have enough for an entry to stand on its own. &amp;nbsp;We&apos;ll see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strike&gt;Nevermind! &amp;nbsp;It turns out that this is quite long. &amp;nbsp;I just spent 20 minutes trying to format this entry with these little frill borders on the top and bottom. &amp;nbsp;I wanted the text to fit exactly between so that the width of it was fixed but it was too complicated and not working. :( &amp;nbsp;If anyone knows how to do that- please let me know!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, first of all, I finally went to the beach on Friday! &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ve been wanting to go all summer so far. &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t even really like the Jersey Shore very much, but I think all this being outside in combination with the new beachy music I have acquired that made me want to go so much. &amp;nbsp;It was really nice and we spent some time on the boardwalk. &amp;nbsp;I brought my film camera (Minolta 9000) with me because it turns out it wasn&apos;t broken at all. &amp;nbsp;I was just really silly and mixed up the exposed and unexposed rolls of film and got the wrong one developed- whoops! &amp;nbsp;Also we went to the house from The Jersey Shore. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s for rent! &amp;nbsp;Below is a photo of me and Alex in front of the garage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs082.ash2/37457_1223293265927_1336830968_30980951_7356403_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/6-8.gif?t=1277874922&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned in my last entry about how I wanted to go see Wavves in the city. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately for me, the show sold out before I could arrange traveling and buy tickets. &amp;nbsp;Someone must have known how upset I was and so they scheduled a last minute show in Montclair, NJ which is about 45 minutes from me. &amp;nbsp;I was so excited and I knew it wouldn&apos;t sell out because tickets were at the door only and it was so last minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, Nick told me he was going to drive and asked if I wanted to go so of course I said yes. &amp;nbsp;We went with Greg, Emanuele and his girlfriend Caitlin. &amp;nbsp;I didn&apos;t know Eman or Caitlin beforehand but they were both very nice. &amp;nbsp;We left around 5 and got to the venue super early. &amp;nbsp;Doors were at 7, I think. &amp;nbsp;I am never driving any of them anywhere because all they did was yell the whole time, which was funny to me because I wasn&apos;t driving, but I wouldn&apos;t have been able to concentrate at all if I was supposed to drive. &amp;nbsp;Also at one point Eman told Nick he had Combos and handed him one and Nick nearly ate it until he realized that Eman had found it on the floor of the car. &amp;nbsp;I almost died. &amp;nbsp;It was too funny. &amp;nbsp;Anyway, the place was like a small basement kind of thing. &amp;nbsp;It was kind of strange. &amp;nbsp;We paid and got our hands stamped. &amp;nbsp;The guy said that it wouldn&apos;t start until 7:45 so we had a crazy amount of time to kill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we were hungry and had never explored the downtown area of Montclair, we decided to wander around and look for food. &amp;nbsp;Pretty much everywhere was on the expensive side and none of us wanted to pay for that. &amp;nbsp;We ended up at a semi-affordable Italian restaurant that we were quite a bit&amp;nbsp;under-dressed&amp;nbsp;for. &amp;nbsp;We were all really amused by the fact that we were even there in the first place. &amp;nbsp;The funniest thing was when some waiter used an espresso machine or something and Eman said it sounded like an alien giving birth. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s not even that funny, but none of us could stop laughing. &amp;nbsp;It was probably a result of the situation we were in at the time; we just thought everything was funny because of how we were in such a fancy restaurant and clearly didn&apos;t belong there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;We went back to the venue after and had to suffer through a few loud punk bands before Ducktails came on. &amp;nbsp;Ducktails is a band with the guy from Real Estate, which is a local band that is getting pretty popular with Pitchfork people. &amp;nbsp;We managed to stay in front for that but I knew it wouldn&apos;t last long. &amp;nbsp;Wavves came on and they were so funny. &amp;nbsp;The drummer ended up naked at some point, but I couldn&apos;t see because of the crazy mosh pit I was trying to avoid. &amp;nbsp;(see below)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ljembed&quot; embedid=&quot;12&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;lj-embed id=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is a photo of my future husband. &amp;nbsp;Ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs142.snc4/36477_1223841759639_1336830831_30982950_2839719_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan Williamz. &amp;nbsp;$uMM3R i$ 43v@~*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of disappoint that I didn&apos;t get to meet him, but we were so gross and soaking wet afterward that we just wanted to leave. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m praying that they will come to MD once they tour after the album is released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/6-8.gif?t=1277874922&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&apos;s pretty much all I have been up to other than lots of math and chemistry work. &amp;nbsp;The NY Renaissance Faire opens this Friday and Tessa and I want to go together! &amp;nbsp;We&apos;d go with her boyfriend and he has never been. &amp;nbsp;I love going with people who are Ren Faire virgins. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s such a good time. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to go and I&apos;ll keep this thing updated.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>I will never die; I&apos;ll go surfing in my mind~~</title>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;I actually made this video last week or something but had issues uploading it. &amp;nbsp;Every time I tried, the audio was out of sync with the video! &amp;nbsp;I just uploaded it to Vimeo instead of Youtube and it worked this time. &amp;nbsp;So hey. &amp;nbsp;Also I find it so awkward to record videos because I don&apos;t know where I am supposed to be looking. &amp;nbsp;It feels weird to look at the camera or look at myself.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;lj-embed id=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/uy162.gif?t=1277229494&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it has been a week or something since I recorded that video. &amp;nbsp;I did finally beat the 8th gym leader, much thanks to Snover&apos;s hail storm. &amp;nbsp;I also started my math course. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s just really tedious but not too bad. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s just a computer program thing that&apos;s connected to the internet. &amp;nbsp;I also started chemistry course too. &amp;nbsp;I hate getting up early for it. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s not that bad though except that I already learned most of the stuff at school so I&apos;m a bit bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;126&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/tsdance.gif?t=1277231952&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Toy Story 3 with Greg and his friend Chris last night. &amp;nbsp;Oh my gosh it was so good. &amp;nbsp;We saw it in 3D because it was all they had in the local theatre. &amp;nbsp;The glasses were too big on Greg; it was so funny. &amp;nbsp;Poor Greg. &amp;nbsp;I don&apos;t remember ever being a huge fan of the previous movies. &amp;nbsp;I think I will need to rewatch them now! &amp;nbsp;It is a must-see. &amp;nbsp;I think it would be equally good without the 3D effects. &amp;nbsp;But I think the little Pixar short film before it is probably cooler in 3D. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m also really excited for Tangled to come out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/uy162.gif?t=1277229494&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;Greg, Dom, and I are so excited about the new Wavves album. &amp;nbsp;It just leaked and it&apos;s so much better than the first. &amp;nbsp;You can actually hear what Nathan is saying. &amp;nbsp;I would really recommend listening to it if you are into Animal Collective, Real Estate, Best Coast or Coldplay. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnSixzVoApw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the song &amp;quot;Mickey Mouse&amp;quot; on Youtube. &amp;nbsp;It really reminds me of AnCo. &amp;nbsp;Anyway they are having a show in Brooklyn on Thursday that I really want to go to but I need someone to go with me. &amp;nbsp;Greg and Dom aren&apos;t sure they can go. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/th_88428.gif?t=1277232997&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;I hope it ends up working out because the show is only $12!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay I need to finish up some math and study for a chemistry quiz. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m visiting Laura in the hospital later because she had back surgery. &amp;nbsp;Also Cait wants me to watch The Pacific but I have to get all this business done first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Untitled-1-1.gif?t=1277232851&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye~&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/tiara.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay I changed my background because I decided the ice cream was too busy and distracting. &amp;nbsp;I was stuck between the one I have now and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gyazo.com/ffce9b80af30aad9ea78645dcef98777.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I kept it like this though. &amp;nbsp;Any thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else is new in my life. &amp;nbsp;To prove it, the highlight of my day yesterday was walking about my backyard barefoot and then getting a phone call. &amp;nbsp;My first thoughts were as follows: 1. I have no friends so who is possibly calling me? &amp;nbsp;2. It&apos;s probably about a job. &amp;nbsp;Okay I was wrong on both accounts... sort of. &amp;nbsp;It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://windowsdown.tumblr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(if you don&apos;t follow him on Tumblr, you totally should) so I just talked to him while going on my swing set and walking around barefoot.&lt;br /&gt;I put in way more applications than I can count on both hands and no one has called me back. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m praying for the Disney Store to hire me. &amp;nbsp;I called them and they said they haven&apos;t been through the applications yet and it should take about a week. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m just hoping for the best. &amp;nbsp;In the meantime I am going to try and make and sell more of &lt;a href=&quot;http://teadaze-.tumblr.com/post/671543960&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these earrings&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I have no idea what to price them at though!&lt;br /&gt;I got a bunch more people added on here recently so I guess I should make some sort of about me post soon. &amp;nbsp;I never know what to write for those. :x&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/pixels/bottledhearts.gif&quot; /&gt;I&apos;m actually really tired right now for some reason even though 11:30 pm is early for me, but I still wanted to write an entry. &amp;nbsp;And of course now that I sit down to do this I have forgotten most of what I was planning to write. &amp;nbsp;I have still been looking for a job since the place that &amp;quot;hired&amp;quot; me still has not given me hours. &amp;nbsp;I even called them twice and the second time the person said they&apos;d have the girl with my papers call me and give me my hours and other information. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s been over a week since they said they would call me and they haven&apos;t done so once. &amp;nbsp;I went around the area with my friend Alex and we applied to everywhere possible. &amp;nbsp;Her car was like a suffocation chamber or something though. &amp;nbsp;It was 85+ outside and her air conditioning didn&apos;t work! &amp;nbsp;Then we went to apply at a Dairy Queen and noticed a new cafe nearby so we went there to apply as well. &amp;nbsp;Alex thought her car could run on empty... but she learned that it couldn&apos;t. &amp;nbsp;It stopped running in the parking lot when she tried to move it from DQ to the cafe. &amp;nbsp;We had to wait for AAA and it was a bit of a disaster. &amp;nbsp;Today I went to the mall with my family and applied to the Disney store which is actually hiring I think! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would like working there; I love Disney so much.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/DVC00065_d.gif?t=1275797541&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yesterday after the whole job search mess, I went with Mary Ann and Anisha to Ben and Jerry&apos;s! &amp;nbsp;I haven&apos;t been there in forever and I haven&apos;t seen the two of them in a long time too. &amp;nbsp;I got coconut seven layer bar and the new Bonnaroo flavour. &amp;nbsp;I never had them before and they were both really good. &amp;nbsp;Then we went back to Anisha&apos;s house and watched Fight Club. &amp;nbsp;I had never seen it before but I liked it a lot. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s a really incredible movie that everyone should watch if they can take the fighting. &amp;nbsp;Anisha said it&apos;s one of her favorite movies but she can&apos;t even watch the violent parts. &amp;nbsp;That proves that it&apos;s a great movie even if you don&apos;t watch most of it.&lt;br /&gt;Also I finally uploaded a new Lookbook look with my altered Pokemon shirt! &amp;nbsp;You can&apos;t really see how I cut it and sewed the ribbons on the front and back here. &amp;nbsp;Oh well. &amp;nbsp;Click on the photo to go to the page.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lookbook.nu/look/780599-Our-hearts-so-true-Our-courage-will-pull-us-through&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://files5.lookbook.nu/files/looks/medium/634933_lookbook5.jpg?1275600505&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lookbook.nu/look/780599-Our-hearts-so-true-Our-courage-will-pull-us-through&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well anyway that&apos;s it for now!&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/th_20090721_1378633.gif?t=1275800334&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>I&apos;ve heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings</title>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/013.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey I finally made a header! &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s just simple text. &amp;nbsp;I actually downloaded that font a while ago because I had it on my old computer, but I couldn&apos;t get it to work for some reason! &amp;nbsp;It just wouldn&apos;t shop up in programs. &amp;nbsp;Apparently all I had to do to get it to work was right click the file and &amp;quot;install&amp;quot; it. &amp;nbsp;I never had to do that before though. &amp;nbsp;Maybe it&apos;s because this is Windows Vista? &amp;nbsp;Anyway, I finally feel like this layout is and also my Tumblr layout are complete. &amp;nbsp;I edited another theme and I really like the way it looks now. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/05080808160215_____P906idocomonejp.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home is still really boring but I did get a job at a kids party place. &amp;nbsp;They said they&apos;d call me this week about when to start but my parents won&apos;t leave me alone about it and insist that I should call them. &amp;nbsp;They hired me so obviously they are going to call me so I feel annoying calling them up and bothering them about it. &amp;nbsp;Maybe they already have people assigned to all the parties this week. &amp;nbsp;Who knows? &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m really happy I have a job now because only recently did I fully realize how every little thing costs money.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing to do around where I live that is free unless it&apos;s watching a movie you already have on DVD or something. &amp;nbsp;I just feel bored always. &amp;nbsp;I bought The Amityville Horror when I went to the Blockbuster with Cait and I still haven&apos;t watched it. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to watch it on the plane home from Colorado but my headphones didn&apos;t block out the sounds of the plane well enough. &amp;nbsp;Maybe I&apos;ll do that today since I think it&apos;s about to rain. &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/88428.gif&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I didn&apos;t even check the weather today but outside it looks windy and I think I hear thunder. &amp;nbsp;Anddd... I just checked and it&apos;s a thunderstorm. &amp;nbsp;AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/l.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&apos;t updated this in a while so here are all the things I did and didn&apos;t share yet. &amp;nbsp; Mostly I have done a whole lot of nothing. &amp;nbsp;One day I went out with Amanda and Hannah and then watched Mean Girls at Hannah&apos;s house. &amp;nbsp;Another day my parents went out to dinner and Amanda came over. &amp;nbsp;We had a tea party but it just got crazy with my sister Lara who dressed up like her Grandma Lara character and was completely insane. &amp;nbsp;One night I sat outside Cold Stone and Starbucks with Nick and Greg for a while. &amp;nbsp;So I finally got to meet Greg and he&apos;s super nice. &amp;nbsp;New friends ftw!&lt;br /&gt;I went to Colorado with my family on Friday and we got back yesterday around 5. &amp;nbsp;We went for my cousin&apos;s bar mitzvah. &amp;nbsp;It was the first time I saw their new house too. &amp;nbsp;On Sunday we went to this butterfly pavilion where they had an exhibit of insects and then a whole area with a bunch of butterflies. &amp;nbsp;I took this one really good photo on my little digital camera that I&apos;m really proud of. &amp;nbsp;It just came out really nice. &amp;nbsp;If you click it, it will send you to the Flickr page to see it larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/hellocarly/4657816288/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4657816288_a46da6a9fb_b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/l.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also currently obsessed with the new LCD Soundsystem single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;lj-embed id=&quot;6&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okay yeah that&apos;s it for now!&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/minis/o0020002010518195939.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;I don&apos;t even know what I&apos;m going to write about in this. &amp;nbsp;Anyway, I&apos;m home for the summer now and it&apos;s currently boring as hell. &amp;nbsp;I want a job but places won&apos;t call me back and my summer course hasn&apos;t started yet. &amp;nbsp;I filled out an application to apply to two Starbucks locations but I didn&apos;t submit it yet. &amp;nbsp;Here&apos;s a tip guys- the physical application that you can pick up from the coffee shops is actually shorter so don&apos;t do the online one; it&apos;s SO LONG. &amp;nbsp;It asks many ridiculous questions like this which I am sure are not included on the paper one, as I have seen it before:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/tumblr_l2pe39xll61qzegzso1_250.png?t=1274395007&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/tumblr_l2kzom3ifN1qzegzso1_400.jpg?t=1274395789&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^ Obviously they should hire me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/e_line_816_li333.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://files.seenly.com/ca777625c000441ebf63966f2c20c71b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&apos;t really done much of anything. &amp;nbsp;I really need a haircut because my bangs are way long (I have to pin them always *see above*) and I want to redye it darker. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m going to have one of my friends do it for me but I&apos;m just not sure when.&lt;br /&gt;So far this break has mostly consisted of me playing Pokemon. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m nearly up to the 8th gym. &amp;nbsp;I just need to get through the ice cave now. &amp;nbsp;Here is my current little trainer card thing. &amp;nbsp;If you take my friend code, leave me yours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i45.tinypic.com/5cze0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/e_line_816_li333.gif?t=1274395345&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my dogs. &amp;nbsp;Pokemon and my dogs are the best things about not having school. &amp;nbsp;My other dog doesn&apos;t like getting picked up as much as this one but you will see him soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/tumblr_l2nbdjtfED1qzegzso1_400.jpg?t=1274395912&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/Me%20me/tumblr_l2l0adBPzS1qzegzso1_400.jpg?t=1274395913&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/bow19.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am finally getting around to writing another entry.  A lot has been going on and leaving me extremely exhausted. The Alice Project was taking up so much of my life.  We just finished up all of the performances on Saturday; it was such a success! &amp;nbsp;Basically I have been working with a group of other students for a whole year on this project. &amp;nbsp;Instead of me doing a crap job of explaining it, here is &lt;strong&gt;our mission statement&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;We are a collective of students from varied classes and departments who are united in our goal of presenting our own take on Lewis Carroll&amp;rsquo;s classic stories of Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. We will use our diverse life experiences to create a theatrical event that transcends our creative boundaries. We will incorporate environmental sustainability by thinking outside the black box theater and setting our piece in Goucher College&amp;rsquo;s environment. By adapting the classic texts and using a variety of techniques, including Commedia Dell&amp;rsquo;Arte and Living History Theatre, we will stretch our theatrical knowledge and continue to challenge ourselves. As theatre makers with specific roles, we are engaging each other in a collaborative process. This process is important to us because the themes the Carroll builds are universal to the human experience. By making our audience active participants in Alice&amp;rsquo;s journey, we aim to reach out to not only the Goucher community but also the Baltimore community at large. In these uncertain times, it is important to explore our identity and to question our surroundings in an environmentally friendly and accessible way.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time having a real role in a play with lines and such. &amp;nbsp;I was a daisy and&amp;nbsp;I wasn&apos;t even nervous for any of the performances! &amp;nbsp;It was an incredible experience for so many reasons. &amp;nbsp;I love everyone that I worked with. &amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;3 &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hphotos-snc3.fbcdn.net/hs532.snc3/30201_1208350892377_1336830831_30922676_6138134_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&apos;cutid1-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-sjc1/hs282.snc3/27743_526656224955_41402108_31351724_7568571_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the crazy window painting we had as our lobby display. &amp;nbsp;The whole cast helped to paint it and it took a really long time, but it looked awesome in the end. &amp;nbsp;We got such positive feedback from it because no one had done anything like it before.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs312.ash1/27743_526656419565_41402108_31351762_6041580_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dustin as The White Rabbit.

We didn&apos;t have a show Friday because it was GIG! &amp;nbsp;GIG is Get into Goucher day which is best described by one of my friends as &amp;quot;everybody&apos;s birthday&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;There was live music and food and my personal favourite was the free cotton candy. &amp;nbsp;The artists that came were Yes Giantess, GZA, Chiddy Bang and The Hood Internet. &amp;nbsp;GZA was too hardcore rap/hip hop for me to handle. &amp;nbsp;Chiddy Bang was kind of fun, but The Hood Internet was my personal favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of fun because it was so nice out! &amp;nbsp;It was actually quite hot so we had to go inside for a water break for a good while. &amp;nbsp;I liked being outside with all my friends during the day. &amp;nbsp;The night was my favorite part though because I had a lot of fun with the people I was with. &amp;nbsp;We ran into Emily, Alisa, Alex, Santos and co. and stayed with them for most of the night. &amp;nbsp;I also met/got better&amp;nbsp;acquainted&amp;nbsp;with some of their other friends. &amp;nbsp;Here are some photos from GIG. &amp;nbsp;There are more behind the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs532.snc3/30201_1208108806325_1336830831_30921801_3628926_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Katlyn and Nancy~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs532.snc3/30201_1208339252086_1336830831_30922582_1813775_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy and Molly- so cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs512.ash1/30201_1208340492117_1336830831_30922600_2559027_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missy and Alex being goofs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-sjc1/hs015.snc3/12326_1279667951909_1236330014_30654930_1409852_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am clearly enjoying myself here.ï»¿&lt;a name=&apos;cutid3-end&apos;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ï»¿&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  Okay well that&apos;s it for now. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m super tired. &amp;nbsp;I just left the library and started this entry whilst I was stuck waiting there for a girl to return my lab notebook. &amp;nbsp;I also have a whole lot of work ahead of me before next Thursday so don&apos;t expect to see another entry for a week. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll have a ton of exciting things to say when I am a free bitch~&lt;br /&gt;((&lt;em&gt;jk there is nothing exciting about going home to a bunch of sassy bitches&lt;/em&gt;))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/thBEC6C0CCC4DC14-1552-aosjgody.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xCarly~*&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>They don&apos;t know the new zero</title>

  <description>I haven&apos;t posted in forever. &amp;nbsp;I was so overwhelmed with school business after spring break! &amp;nbsp;At least my life has been pretty exciting. &amp;nbsp;I did some fun things over the past few weeks. &lt;br /&gt;First of all I went to 2 shows. &amp;nbsp;The first one was Arctic Monkeys with Cait. &amp;nbsp;We didn&apos;t know we were going until the day before because the guy she knows at Ram&apos;s Head didn&apos;t tell her until then. &amp;nbsp;She didn&apos;t get a photo pass though so that was a little bit sad but the show was so good. Alex Turner is a beautiful soul. &amp;nbsp;The day that we went was the day there was no water on campus. &amp;nbsp;I came back and felt so gross and couldn&apos;t shower! &amp;nbsp;It was absolutely awful. &amp;nbsp;I really wanted to ask Alex Turner if I could take a shower on his tour bus. ;b&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here is a photo I took showing how close we were. &amp;nbsp;We were as close to the photo barricade thing but way off to the right. &amp;nbsp;I use a regular point and shoot digital camera so the zoom is crap. &amp;nbsp;Just to put it in perspective.~*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://hphotos-sjc1.fbcdn.net/hs467.snc3/25636_1201871570398_1336830831_30901341_1160966_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Molly and I went on a Baltimore adventure when we spontaneously decided to go see Rasputina at Ottobar. &amp;nbsp;We took the collegetown shuttle to Penn Station and a cab to the venue. &amp;nbsp;It was such a bizarre crowd there. &amp;nbsp;I should not have been surprised that most of the people there were dressed like goths, but not the mall kind of goths. &amp;nbsp;No they were the goths they show on old movies with black lipstick. &amp;nbsp;I had never seen anything like it before in my life. &amp;nbsp;Molly and I were so awkward because I was wearing my turquoise Northface and we both had the sharpie x&apos;s on our hands. &amp;nbsp;We felt so out of place. &amp;nbsp;The opening group Prudence Teacup was so good! &amp;nbsp;And of course Rasputina was awesome. &amp;nbsp;I have wanted to see them for such a long time. &amp;nbsp;Melora is such an incredibly talented artist and she&apos;s really funny. &amp;nbsp;Here is an okay quality photo from the show. &amp;nbsp;We were pretty close. &amp;nbsp;Also Ottobar doesn&apos;t care about cameras so when I finally get a SLR camera I will be there pretty often I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs467.snc3/25636_1202331141887_1336830831_30902185_896831_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/ichigo08.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/hellocarly/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs449.ash1/24756_1204392753426_1336830831_30909837_3684762_n.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cait and I went to see the screening of Oddsac (the Animal Collective) visual album) at The Senator.  It was so trippy and really cool. &amp;nbsp;I was only slightly disappoint because Panda Bear wasn&apos;t there; it was only Deakin and Geologist. &amp;nbsp;I also walked right past Deakin when leaving and really really regret not taking a photo with him. &amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/3 &amp;nbsp;I really can&apos;t wait for it to be released on DVD because I am definitely going to buy that. &amp;nbsp;I also went to the Fell&apos;s Point Pirate Festival with Katlyn two weeks ago but I will post photos of that once she uploads hers because she has a better camera. ;b&lt;br /&gt;Okay that&apos;s all for now~*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/21342259.gif?t=1271791069&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Carly&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <title>A serious post.</title>
  <link>http://princesspeachhh.livejournal.com/3056.html</link>
  <description>I declared my major of biology with an art minor today and you would think that would be a happy thing.  It is satisfying but I am still confused about what I want with my life.  I have wanted to do forensic science for forever but I didnâ€™t know what specifically.  Even after I did a UPenn summer program on it I still didnâ€™t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went into college feeling confident about a biology major but itâ€™s so much harder than I thought.  I lot of people quit the science/premed track after the first semester because it was harder than they expected.  I wasnâ€™t doing so horribly so I continued this semester.  Itâ€™s still really difficult for me though, especially because Iâ€™m awful at math and memorization; Iâ€™m just really good at concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I had a revelation that I wanted to do forensic pathology aka be a medical examiner aka do autopsies.  I had written off that option during my summer program because it requires medical school and I just canâ€™t be bothered with that much extra school and residency etc.  So recently I have been considering that but the people in the pre-med track at my school are so incredibly smart.  My school has a really high medical school acceptance rate but I honestly think itâ€™s partially because we get a run-off of really smart kids who came here for the money or because they didnâ€™t get into their top choices.  I know so many people in the science department who are doing so much better than I am.  I am studying harder than I ever have in my life but I just canâ€™t seem to get as good grades as they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other option is art because I am actually naturally talented in that.  I really donâ€™t want to do art as a job because I feel like it would take the fun out of it, as would art as a major.  I kind of dislike art right now even because of the design class Iâ€™m in.  Iâ€™m not making anything quality and everyone in the class just makes me angry (except for Cait).  The teacher is a nice woman but I donâ€™t love the way she grades etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically I am confused and therefore upset.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;It has been forever since I posted an entry here. &amp;nbsp;I just got so overwhelmed with everything once I came back to school. &amp;nbsp;Once I had free time it was late at night and I didn&apos;t have the brain power to type something out. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s almost 12:30 am now but I don&apos;t feel like getting up off this couch so here I am~*. &amp;nbsp;Now I&apos;m trying to think of new and exciting things about my life so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/2lvg5z5.jpg?t=1270011794&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/2lvg5z5.jpg?t=1270011794&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kznu71a0P41qzegzso1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my Gameboy Colour and I hardly ever use the thing but it&apos;s like a relic so I haven&apos;t gotten rid of it. &amp;nbsp;I am finally putting it to use this semester since Scott and I are planning to team battle my friend Kenzlie and her boyfriend Conor gold/silver/crystal style. &amp;nbsp;They are so going down. &amp;nbsp;We are taking this very very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;On the same subject of Pokemon, I bought the SoulSilver version and I am loving it! &amp;nbsp;The day it came out my dad took me and my brother to the GameStop but the power was out because of a huge storm and they couldn&apos;t sell anything. &amp;nbsp;So my dad drove us all the way to another one just so my brother (mainly) could get the game. &amp;nbsp;I made so many friends since I got that game. &amp;nbsp;Who knew how many other people my age loved Pokemon? &amp;nbsp;My mom thought I would be the only one at my school with a Pokewalker; obviously she has no idea what kind of school I go to since so many of my friends play. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m kind of far behind as I am still working on my 6th badge. &amp;nbsp;I just got so overwhelmed with classes and things which is pretty unfortunate but that&apos;s college for ya. &amp;nbsp;The Pokewalker is the cutest thing ever; I connect with my friends when I pass them on the way to class. &amp;nbsp;It&apos;s kind of silly but I enjoy it. &amp;nbsp;Here is a photo of me putting my Togepi back into my DS from the Pokewalker when I was home over break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzei9asFML1qzegzso1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got that big bow headband while I was home over break as well. &amp;nbsp;I wear it so often and I got it for cheap at Annie Sez along with my new Betsey Johnson sunglasses which I love so much. &amp;nbsp;I needed new ones to replace the ones that I lent Shibley because he hasn&apos;t given them back to me. &amp;gt;_&amp;lt; &amp;nbsp;I love that store so much. &amp;nbsp;I always find something that I really like when I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh I neglected to mention one of my favourite things that I did since I have been back at school. &amp;nbsp;Last weekend I went on a really fun adventure with Cait. &amp;nbsp;We went to a Blockbuster that is going out of business and then Target so I got awesome deals on movies. &amp;nbsp;Now I can have my own movie collection for real. &amp;nbsp;The Edward Scissorhands blu-ray film is from Target and I got it for $10. &amp;nbsp;The rest were from Blockbuster and they were $7. &amp;nbsp;Such a steal. &amp;nbsp;I then went to her house and met her dog Desmond and then we went out to dinner at the most amazing pizza restaurant ever. &amp;nbsp;The food was so good. &amp;nbsp;Then, of course we finished the day with Rita&apos;s because how could we not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzywfmBoQg1qzegzso1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Pokemon~* &amp;nbsp;I am only pretty sure that I want to keep Jirachi and Dratini in my permanent lineup for the elite four. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;m not sure about the others but Jirachi is already my best Pokemon and I just love Dratini. &amp;nbsp;I think it has a lot of potential. &amp;nbsp;I missed the Jirachi event by a day but someone nice from tumblr gave me his because he didn&apos;t want it. &amp;lt;/3&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I need to get to bed because I have class pretty early tomorrow, as usual. &amp;nbsp;I will leave you with this photo of me playing Pokemon in the dark because that&apos;s how I roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzuytrtNjp1qzegzso1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/th_myAvatar_17001460_1.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xxx Carly&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>I think I finally settled on a layout. &amp;nbsp;This one wins. &amp;nbsp;I just want to make a header for it in the future because the top of it looks so naked. &amp;nbsp;I&apos;ll draw&lt;br /&gt;something for it sometime soon, I hope.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am currently on a bus going home. &amp;nbsp;I had so many issues figuring this trip out. &amp;nbsp;My friends and I were planning it for a while so that we could go see the high school musicals in my town and Eryn&apos;s town. &amp;nbsp;It snowed so much in New Jersey the past two days that the buses yesterday got cancelled and even if they didn&apos;t, my parents would not have been able to pick us up from the city. &amp;nbsp;So we went through absolute hell to get on a bus for this morning. &amp;nbsp;It involved changing our tickets 2x and about 7 phone calls. &amp;nbsp;At least we&apos;re all here on the bus now. &amp;nbsp;Thank goodness for internet. &amp;nbsp;I just hate how some of these buses don&apos;t have outlets. &amp;nbsp;They make me want to kill something. &amp;nbsp;The first time I went on one of these, there were no outlets. &amp;nbsp;So the second time I didn&apos;t pack my charger in my carry on and then there were outlets! &amp;nbsp;It was such a FML moment but now I take my charger with me all the time. &amp;nbsp;However, this bus only has a few chargers scattered around. &amp;nbsp;I didn&apos;t notice it until after I picked my seat. &amp;nbsp;Oh well... &amp;nbsp;I want to play some Animal Crossing and study for my bio lab practical anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&apos;m listening to Gogol Bordello right now. &amp;nbsp;It won&apos;t show up in my &amp;quot;listening to&amp;quot; section because I&apos;m not using last.fm because I want to save battery so I&apos;m using my ipod. &amp;nbsp;I can&apos;t wait to see them in a month or so. &amp;nbsp;They were amazing when I saw them over the summer. &amp;nbsp;It was so fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v131/justxaxgirl/borrowed%20stuff/illust1927_thumb.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here is a photo of a drawing I did in English. &amp;nbsp;I cut it off the worksheet and glued it in my moleskine and then made it look nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyhda4ODy91qzegzso1_400.jpg&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kyhd04HXnL1qzegzso1_400.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
