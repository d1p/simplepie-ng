				<title>Connect An XBox 360 to Your Home Wireless Without the Adapter</title>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft has always been they will sell you the bare basics and then charge you&amp;#160;exorbitant&amp;#160;prices for any extra add-ons and the Xbox 360 is no exception to the rule. As most houses are now days you will probably all have wireless Internet throughout your house, just leaving the router somewhere out of site. So sometimes connecting your Xbox to the Internet with a cable is not the easiest or tidiest thing, but buying a wireless adapter for the console seems a bit too pricey. So what can you do for an easy fix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little note, for this to work you will need a laptop with wireless access or even &amp;#160;your desktop computer, if it has a wireless adapter, but obviously a desktop computer is not the easiest for&amp;#160;manoeuvrability&amp;#160;and a lot less convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this is a guide based on Windows XP, when working with&amp;#160;newer&amp;#160;versions of Windows this guide should still stick to the same instructions with only slight changes, like finding the Network Connections page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First you will need to connect your&amp;#160;Ethernet&amp;#160;cable from the back of the Xbox into the laptops port.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now you will need to head into Network Connections in the Control Panel: Start &amp;gt; Control Panel &amp;gt; Network Connections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then you will need to find your wireless connection and your&amp;#160;Ethernet&amp;#160;connection. With them both&amp;#160;highlighted&amp;#160;right click on one and click Bridge Connections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now it should be all ready to go but you may need to refresh the connections and try reconnecting to the network.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good luck with anyone trying this and send me an email if you come across any problems and I can try to help you out.&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

				<title>Avoid Machines and Go Straight to a Live Person</title>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you are the owner of a mobile/home phone or have local access to the Internet then you would have come across one of those interactive voice response(IVR) systems where you have to go through option to option until you finally reach a live person. If you are one of the many population who does not want to deal with these annoying machines or is sick of having them not understand simple commands like "yes" or "no" then &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.gethuman.com"&gt;GetHuman&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect website to show you some of the many tips on how to get straight through to an operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a user of American Express then call 1300 132 639&amp;#160;			and press 0#.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to speak to Vodafone and want to avoid IVR you can call 0414 123 123 or 0414 141 414.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or what seems like a slower but still helpful option to contact Optus is to call 1300300937, say&amp;#160; nothing and let the sytem time out which will transfer you to an operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot vouch for 100% accuracy of these tips but it is definitely worth a shot to avoid an IVR machine. Go have a browse for yourself on the Australian section of the website to save yourself some time and trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://gethuman.com/numbers/australia"&gt;GetHuman - Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>How to Increase Your Security While Downloading Torrents</title>
        <author><name>Mitchell Cash</name></author> 
				<link>http://handyhax.webs.com/apps/blog/show/4720436</link>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a&amp;#160;beginner or an advanced torrent downloader you may have already come across&amp;#160;&amp;#160;an email from your ISP or a copyright&amp;#160;enforcement&amp;#160;company, like BayTSP which seems to work alongside TPG, warning you about the&amp;#160;infringement&amp;#160;on the legal rights of other persons. (I have attached the email I received from BayTSP forwarded through by TPG &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://handyhax.webs.com/TPG-BayTSP%20Infringment%20Notice.docx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So by now you may be sick of receiving such emails or are staying on the safe side and want to avoid these companies from the get go by blocking their IPs before you even download your first torrent. To do this I have set out a guide below outlining the steps you need to stay anonymous on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First of all you will want to go to the PeerGuardian website and&amp;#160;download&amp;#160;the latest version of their product from the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The installation is simple enough to get through and you should have no problems with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you first run the program you will be asked to choose from a list of options on what you would like PeerGuardian to actually block from accessing your computer. (It&amp;#160;recommends&amp;#160;to block all HTTP and then allow access from there but the choice is up to you.) But the option we are focusing on here is the P2P option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After selecting this option you will run through a few update options where you can decide when you want to update your software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After PeerGuardian has&amp;#160;updated&amp;#160;its P2P blacklist the program will make sure you never connect to any of the IP addresses on the blacklist thus making your torrent downloading a safer experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;Using PeerGuardian is just one of many options and I have only decided to focus on it for now, but if you would like another piece of software reviewed that is similiar to PeerGuardian just contact me with your request and I will hopefully have something posted very soon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although this program will try to blacklist as many bad IP addresses as possible it can never be 100% certain it has got them all, so a &amp;#160;nice and safe option would be to try and find a private (the more private, the safer) tracker and use that for all your torrent downloading.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
