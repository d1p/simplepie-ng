			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Board of Directors of the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund cordially invites you to join us for the annual grant ceremony where the 2011 grant recipient and finalists will be announced. The annual Smith grant of $30,000 is considered one of the most prestigious honors in photojournalism. A special fellowship of $5,000 will also be presented.</p>
<p>The event will occur <b>on Wednesday, October 19th, at 6:30 PM</b> at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=asia,+society,+725+Park+Ave+at+70th+St.,+New+York+City&#038;hl=en&#038;cid=11332701243361241153" target="_blank"><b>Asia Society, 725 Park Ave at 70th St., New York City</b></a>. Please join us.</p>
<p>The program will include a keynote address, guest speakers (TBA), audio-visual presentations by this year’s finalists, as well as tributes to Smith and past honorees. More details will follow in the official invitation email blast in September.</p>
<p>An RSVP is not necessary. Admission is free, and on a first come, first served basis. The doors will open at 6 PM. The event will be followed by a reception.</p>
<p>The W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography is presented annually to a photographer whose past work and proposed project, as judged by a panel of experts, follows the tradition of W. Eugene Smith’s concerned photography and dedicated compassion exhibited during his 45-year career as a photographic essayist.  The Smith Grant was established in 1978 following the death of Gene Smith.</p>
<p>The W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, independently administers the grant program that provides photographers with the financial freedom to carry out or complete major photographic essays. For 2011, the amount of the grant will be $30,000. An additional $5,000 in fellowship money will be dispersed, at the discretion of the jury, to one or more finalists deemed worthy of special recognition.</p>
<p>For more information, please visit our newly redesigned Web site at:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MediaStorm has been collaborating with photojournalist Seamus Murphy to complete a documentary film based on his work <a href="http://mediastorm.com/publication/a-darkness-visible-afghanistan"><em>A Darkness Visible: Afghanistan</em></a>. We have started a fundraising campaign on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/296425281/a-darkness-visible-afghanistan" target="_blank">KickStarter</a> to finish this film and get it launched.</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://mediastorm.com/player/embed.php?id=e4e4ae7ef1149b445164&#038;w=500&#038;h=304"></script></p>

Afghanistan’s recent history is a roller-coaster of foreign involvement and abandonment, resulting in a global crisis the world continues to struggles with today. The country was granted hero-status by the West when it resisted the Soviet invasion. But the vicious civil war that followed the Soviet withdrawal, the rise of the Taliban and the al Qaeda attacks launched from its soil on 9/11 made it into a pariah state. Afghanistan has been invaded, used and mythologized, but rarely understood.</p>
<p>This project is the result of over 15 years traveling and photographing in Afghanistan, recording unexpected stories of struggle, survival and hope. My mission is to promote an understanding of this mysterious, complex and fascinating culture in order  to help bring about a real and lasting peace.</p>
<p>You can help support Seamus and <em>A Darkness Visible</em> by donating on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/296425281/a-darkness-visible-afghanistan" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Aperture will be hosting an interactive exhibition in September, inviting both selected guests and gallery visitors to participate. Here is the project, in their words:</em></p>
<p>What should we be looking at? The extraordinary number of photographs taken on September 11 made it the most photographed event in history and may have signaled the birth of citizen journalism. However in our impulse to record, we have not formulated new strategies to gain a better understanding of today’s pressing issues of a globalized world.</p>
<p>As traditional print journalism was threatened, and the number of images published online has exploded into the billions (sixty billion on Facebook alone), we have been left with few common sources of news and analysis. There is no longer a “front page” to act as a societal filter through which, we can learn about important events and trends. Even the role that the physical café once played in our communities—the place we went to discuss and digest what’s going on around us — has become fragmented across a myriad of virtual spaces.</p>
<p>Where should we turn for our information? How can we function as a society with so few common reference points? How can we intelligently sort through all the images and information available to us? In terms of photography and visual information, what should we be looking at?</p>
<p>Ten years post-9/11, at a time when we are more overloaded with information than ever but cannot access it in a coherent manner, Aperture will create a visual café for collective social engagement with the question: What Matter’s Now? and turn it into an evolving exhibition space. During a two-week period Aperture will turn itself “inside out,” letting participants engage in the editorial process of weighing questions, ideas, and images, and proposing conceptual and curatorial solutions. Both invited guests and gallery visitors will be asked to participate.  The exhibition <strong>What Matters Now? Proposals for a New Front Page</strong> will combine the crowd sourcing of images and ideas with the curatorial engagement of six experienced individuals, each hosting a table and a conversation within the space, where on corresponding walls each group will present its proposals for the contents of a ‘New Front Page’.  Hosts include a variety of visual image specialists: Wafaa Bilal, Melissa Harris, Stephen Mayes, Joel Meyerowitz, Fred Ritchin (who conceptualized this project) and Deborah Willis.</p>
<p>As the exhibition opens, each of the hosts will have a designated space, but the walls will be empty. Progressively throughout the first two weeks of the “exhibition,” the walls will be filled in whatever manner each table decides. As the exhibition emerges, its contents will be posted online, daily, via a dedicated blog, as well as via Facebook and Twitter, at <a href="http://aperture.org/whatmattersnow" target="_blank">aperture.org/whatmattersnow</a> and#whatmattersnow; allowing remote participants to respond and to create a seventh wall dedicated to ideas from the public. This website will go live prior to the opening of the exhibition.</p>
<p>Computers, printers, phones and iPads will be used by hosts and audience members for the duration of the exhibition. Materials may be printed, projected, hung and even destroyed as the exhibition progresses. Hosts might decide that what we should all be looking at is a particular Renaissance painting, or the work of particular photojournalists, or a thousand mini print-outs of images sourced online—or nothing at all. Contributions will be solicited from people around the world who are not able to visit in person. By sending files to dedicated email addresses set up for each table, as well as a general account, remote participants will be able to add their suggestions of imagery, multimedia projects and websites as part of the exhibition in-process.</p>
<p>Printed work in this exhibition will be made onsite, made possible by the generous support of Canon,using Canon image PROGRAF iPF6350 large format printers.                            </p>

<div id="attachment_3642" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 490px"><a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gear_detail5_compressed.jpg"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_2271-1024x662.jpg" alt="Rick Gershon - Gear" title="Rick Gershon - Gear" width="1024" height="662" class="size-large wp-image-3642" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Click Image for Gear Details</p></div>
<p><strong>Can you give us a general overview of your kit and the gear you’re using?</strong></p>
<p>As you can see I have a ton of gear. You certainly don&#8217;t have to have all this gear to do it, but I use every single piece of it. A lot of this gear is honestly used to make the <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=CAE5D2" target="_blank">Canon 5D Mark II</a> function like a professional video camera. It&#8217;s a still camera. It&#8217;s not built to be a video camera. To shoot rock solid video and be able to hand hold it without it looking like <em>Blair Witch Project</em> you need certain things. <em>This is a kit that I built up over years and years of failing.</em> Each one of these pieces was bought after I wasn&#8217;t able to do something that I wanted to do. Shooting, failing, and fixing it. That&#8217;s really what it&#8217;s about. Going out and shooting, not getting the results I want, deciding why I didn&#8217;t get those results, and then trying to fix that. </p>
<p>A lot of this also comes from going somewhere international and not having an adapter or not being able to find one, or working in Mexico and breaking my monitor cable for my <a href="http://www.smallhd.com/Products/DP6.html">monitor</a> and going to ten different electronic shops to find one. Now I travel with 4. And at the time I travelled with 3, and I broke 2 of them. It&#8217;s a matter of experience and getting everything to where I&#8217;m comfortable. I know I have everything. I probably travel with more than I need. I prefer to have 2 to 3 of everything so that I&#8217;m prepared. </p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your shooting style?</strong></p>
<p>I have a run-and-gun style but it depends on the shoot. If I&#8217;m doing a pure documentary shoot I try to get my camera rig as small and low-profile as possible. If it&#8217;s more of an advertising shoot, then I&#8217;ll use a more built out rig. A big part of run-and-gun documentary work is having a kit that is easy to carry and easy to work with. I know from this table it doesn&#8217;t look like this is that, but it actually is. Everything on here is tailored to a smaller set up.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s get specific on gear, what do you use?</strong></p>
<p>I have two carbon fiber tripods (<a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=MIDS20SDV2" target="_blank">Miller DV20</a>, <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=SAFSB8TMLCFS" target="_blank">Sachtler FSB-8T</a>), both of them do very different things, both are super useful. The reason I carry two tripods is for two camera interviews and the slider takes two tripods. My  rig allows me to keep my camera steady while also keeping it low profile. I have two basic <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=RE80030023" target="_blank">Redrock</a> setups, one is a shoulder rig that&#8217;s a little bigger with weights and everything, and the other is smaller hand-held rig. I have a monitor which is key. If I&#8217;m doing a bigger shoot, like an ad shoot where it&#8217;s easier to work and I have more time, then I&#8217;ll bring a full light kit. On international gigs I usually don&#8217;t bring a full light kit, I try to just use available light. </p>
<p>Really to me this is about multiples of everything: I have 6 adapters, 6 batteries, 2 chargers, 5 cards, 2 circular ND filters, a 6 stop filter, and a few UV filters, 5 XLR cables, 2 Shotgun mics, <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=SEEW100EN3A" target="_blank">2 Sennheiser Wireless Kits</a>, I have a couple of different small hot shoe mountable shotgun mics, 3 or 4 HDMI cables for my <a href="http://www.smallhd.com/Products/DP6.html">monitor</a>, multiple tripod mount plates because they disappear, I always bring a couple leathermans, I bring two or three headlamps which is totally insane and OCD, but I do it anyway. I have to travel with two mic holding shock mounts because they break easily. I travel with tons of batteries because international batteries suck. One time I was stuck in China and I ran out of batteries and I got some cheap batteries from a market and literally, they would go out in 30 minutes. Velcro, gaff tape &#8211; always bring gaff tape. All that on top of my camera kit: I have two camera bodies, 5 lenses and an extender, and I usually travel with another still body like my <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=LEM9B" target="_blank">Leica</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do you pack all of that?</strong></p>
<p>When I&#8217;m packing I bring a smaller carry-on that has my essential gear, so that&#8217;s my camera and my lenses, my cards, and some batteries. So if the rest of my gear was stolen or lost, I could still get the job done, I could still work. That&#8217;s leftover from my old journalist days, you always have your camera with you on the plane. It&#8217;s kind of getting hard with all this gear. I really do need a lot of the stuff that I check but I could still get the job done. I also carry a 17&#8243; MacBook Pro, 2 <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=GTGD42000" target="_blank">2TB G-Drives</a>. I carry at least 5 or 6 firewire 800, 400, and 400 to 800 cords, 3 CF card readers, 2 SD card readers. That goes in the carry-on as well.</p>

<p><strong>How are you managing data in the field?</strong></p>
<p>I keep my cards on me and at the end of the day I go home and download it and then I back it up. So I usually do 2 hard drives, sometimes 3, it just depends on the situation. <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=GTGD42000" target="_blank">2 Drives</a>: download to the first one, backup to the second one. I download often and backup immediately.  </p>
<p><strong>Work-flow wise, when you&#8217;ve got all that data and you come back state-side, what are you doing with it?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing I do no matter how jet lagged I am is bring in the drives and have them downloaded to more stable and secure drives. And then back those up again, so that they&#8217;re in 4 places. So even if I get in at 6:00 in the morning after flying for two days I&#8217;ll come straight here and drop off my hard drives because I never want anything to happen to them. On some gigs clients will want me to ship a hard drive back to them. So then I have three drives at all times and download to one, backup to the others, and then ship one back. Whenever I travel I put the hard drives in different peoples bags just so they&#8217;re never in the same place in case a bag gets stolen, lost, or water gets in it.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about electricity and batteries, when you&#8217;re planning on powering all of this gear for a shoot what&#8217;s going through your mind in terms of power requirements in the field and electricity differences? </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s really batteries, that&#8217;s why I carry six batteries. I don&#8217;t usually go through that many in a day. Honestly I should probably get more. I&#8217;d be more comfortable if I had two or three more. I have just enough to get through a 10 hour day right now. I always carry my chargers if I ever have a chance to stop with a place that has electricity I plug them in. You just never know when you&#8217;re going to have the chance to charge. Always, always, always keep your batteries charged. That&#8217;s the key. </p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about this with audio. It seems like audio can really bring down a visually gorgeous piece. How do you make sure the audio isn&#8217;t lacking?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a huge challenge for these cameras. I personally do not like to record sound separately. There&#8217;s a couple reasons. It takes a lot of time to sync up in post and it&#8217;s also just another piece of gear that I have to think about turning on and off. And honestly, the less on and off record buttons I have to press the better. </p>
<p>I like to use the <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=JUDT454" target="_blank">juicedLink</a>, I&#8217;ve tried a lot of different audio adapters and that one is the best. It&#8217;s super low noise. It takes a little bit to get dialed in correctly though. You don&#8217;t want to buy it out of the box and go shoot with it, you want to practice. I&#8217;ve failed with it a lot, you&#8217;ve got to fail with your gear. You&#8217;ve got to know it really well, you have to be able to put this stuff together in the dark. </p>
<p>I also really like the new <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=ROVMP" target="_blank">Rode VideoMic Pro</a>. It&#8217;s an awesome broadcast quality small shotgun mic. I really love using that for ambient stuff when I&#8217;m not doing an interview or I don&#8217;t have essential narrative audio going on. I&#8217;m a photographer first so audio is definitely second to me, but learning how to get good audio, especially with these 5D cameras, really puts you ahead of the game. The 5D is not a real hard camera to get a beautiful image out of. A lot of people can take it out get something beautiful out of it. But to really operate it like a pro camera and get great audio takes some practice. </p>
<p><strong>How can people step up their game?</strong></p>
<p>I can tell you there are a few things that separate an amateur kit from a pro kit. Things that will really up your game. </p>
<p>1) <em>A really good tripod and head (<a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=MIDS20SDV2" target="_blank">Miller DV20</a>, <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=SAFSB8TMLCFS" target="_blank">Sachtler FSB-8T</a>).</em> People buy cheap amateur tripods and their video is shaky, and it doesn&#8217;t look good. All they can do is the set off locked shots. Shots that are too shaky and aren&#8217;t on the tripod can look super amateur but also stuff that&#8217;s too locked down can look amateur too. To step up your game one thing that can really help is a really good tripod and fluid pan/tilt head, a good video head. </p>
<p>2) <em>Working with <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=SIVNDT77" target="_blank">ND Filters</a>.</em> That&#8217;s a big step when it comes to using this 5D. These cameras do not look good in broad daylight. They don&#8217;t look good stopped down. I use a variable ND filter that allows me to have that flexibility and being able to shoot shallow in bring sun really ups your game on a video level. </p>
<p>3)<em> Working off a <a href="http://www.smallhd.com/Products/DP6.html">monitor</a>.</em> The screens on the backs of those cameras suck. It’s really hard to focus off of and it doesn&#8217;t give you a lot of freedom for putting the camera in different positions. I bought a nice external monitor and it&#8217;s really changed my game. It’s allowed me to get the camera in different positions its allowed me to get critical focus every single time and that&#8217;s huge. </p>
<p>4) <em>Having a <a href="http://mer54715.datafeedfile.com/widget_prdt_click.php?aff_num=4754&#038;aff_net=1&#038;type=text_link&#038;size=na&#038;mode=na&#038;sku=RE80030023" target="_blank">good stabilization rig</a>.</em> Handholding that camera without a rig, you know you transfer all of your body movements and shake into that camera, and it shows big time. Having a good stabilization rig that you’re comfortable with but that also allows you to shoot well will up your game. People can err on the other side, having too big of a rig, having too much cumbersome equipment that doesn&#8217;t allow them to be fluid and doesn&#8217;t allow them to work well. </p>
<p>What it boils down to though is that story is king. All this equipment is for the point of allowing me to tell a story in the best way possible. And if I ever have gear that gets in the way of that, then I need to get rid of it. If I ever have gear that keeps me from getting to the heart of my story and connecting with my subjects, than it&#8217;s not worth it. <em>I&#8217;ll sell it</em>. </p>
<p>What people need to learn is that they need to build up the kit that works for them, that&#8217;s the most comfortable for them in the field. If you&#8217;re not comfortable shooting with something in the field, you&#8217;re not going to make great images and you’re not going to tell a great story. </p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>My advice is to find out what works best for you. Ask a lot of people. Definitely don&#8217;t look at what I have and go buy it. Ask 4 or 5 other people who are doing work you admire and find out what they all use. Tailor your kit to your needs and then practice, practice, practice. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.unc.edu/index.htm">University of Northern Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> has launched this year’s <a href="http://poweringanation.org/">Powering A Nation site</a>, highlighting our country’s complicated relationship with coal. Throughout your experience on the site you’re introduced to miners who depend on the black rock for their livelihoods, local citizens who suffer from its adverse health effects, and everyday folks who flip on a light switch without thinking twice about what it takes to create that power. </p>
<p>The stories in, “Coal: A Love Story” give you a new appreciation for the complexities surrounding the coal and energy industry. The piece represents an innovative form of journalism where the audience is given all sides of the story and allowed to explore the issues they care about through interactive graphics and source data.  </p>

<a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MG_8045.jpg"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MG_8045.jpg" alt="John Temple" title="John Temple" width="256" height="256" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3604" /></a><br />
<strong>Everyone in journalism seems to be talking about how much the industry is changing. What do you believe are the key trends in the industry and how do you believe journalism will adapt?</strong></p>
<p>I think the most important trend is probably an overall sense of disruption where there is no certainty that any approach that has been successful in the past will continue to be viable or support serious journalistic enterprises in the future. That&#8217;s perhaps the largest trend, dramatic disruption of the traditional business model. And then related to that is the convergence of media where, in the hands of an individual are tools that are as powerful as what major corporations had to invest significant amounts of dollars in. The barriers to entry are so low today that it&#8217;s completely transformed and raised questions about what is journalism and who does it. </p>
<p><strong>When you were with Rocky Mountain News in Colorado you collaborated with MediaStorm on a piece about the Democratic National Convention coming to Denver. Can you talk about how that project worked?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost hard to believe it&#8217;s not even three years ago since we worked together with MediaStorm. In some ways the Democratic National Convention in Denver arguably was the high point of journalism at the Rocky Mountain News because we had branched out into multimedia and online journalism. What was great about that particular experience was that by working as a team it wasn&#8217;t just MediaStorm producing a documentary, it was a collaboration. We learned a lot from working with MediaStorm and were able to elevate the skill level and the sophistication of our staff because we combined it with training. So really positive experience for the Rocky Mountain News, and I think it made it possible for us to produce the documentary we did on the closing of the Rocky which was called Final Edition and which ultimately won a regional Emmy for documentaries. And I don&#8217;t think that would have been possible without working with MediaStorm first and refining our multimedia storytelling skills. </p>
<p><a href="http://mediastorm.com/clients/at-last-a-dream-fulfilled-for-rocky-mountain-news"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/c0020-dream-fulfilled.jpg" alt="At last, at last, a dream fulfilled" title="At last, at last, a dream fulfilled" width="768" height="432" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3625" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What were the takeaways from working with MediaStorm?</strong></p>
<p>I think how to think about structure. There was a real awareness of structure and there was a real commitment to audio that I think was really important. And also just frankly the quality of the people on the team. The MediaStorm team was really great. It’s always fun to work with really highly skilled people that you haven’t worked with before. Because it’s inevitable that in the collaboration you’re going to learn a lot from each other and I think that happened.</p>
<p>I think MediaStorm came up with a good way to tell the story, which was through the journalists covering the story. In many ways it&#8217;s always good for journalists to be interviewed because it reminds them of what it&#8217;s like to be on the other side of the microphone. They were doing two camera interviews and the lighting was really interesting. So you learn what it took to do that level of interviews.</p>
<p><strong>At <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/">Civil Beat</a> you have a very community oriented approach to how you engage your audience. You use a combination of social media tools directly in your site and you have staffers that keep up regular blogs and twitter feeds. How is audience engagement going evolve in the future?</strong></p>
<p>We see our journalism starting from a question. The idea is that by asking questions we&#8217;re going to make the world a better place, we&#8217;re going to make our community a better place, that questioning leads to change. We&#8217;re hoping to identify a community that wants to ask questions. When we do that, they&#8217;re engaged in a dialogue with us where they&#8217;re really asking us to do their work for them. There is a loop there, there is a form of dialogue there that ultimately leads to a self-awareness in the community and a possibility of change. </p>
<p><strong>The other thing that I noticed when I was going through your site is that you do a nice job of doing a truth check on everything. It seems like most sites only do that when something is questionable. There are a lot of examples on your site where you state that things have been said truthfully and you don&#8217;t see that too often on other sites. </strong></p>
<p>We try not to make that a &#8220;gotcha&#8221; feature. We try to make it a feature that is more based on the question, &#8220;Could that really be true?&#8221; So we definitely do not want them all to be &#8216;false&#8217;. We want it to be that anytime someone says a defining or important statement we help people determine if they can believe it. The other thing we do is post them in progress. We can get hung up on waiting until we find the answer, and instead of doing that we post the statement and whatever we can find out about it to begin with. Then you see how people interact with it and what questions they ask. We think people learn more by those kinds of features than they do by traditional news stories where there is a conventional narrative structure. In this way you might get a quasi-civics lesson without really knowing you’re getting one, because you&#8217;re explaining how a court system works for example. We have some in the works right now, <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/fact_checks/2011/07/11/12049-fact-check-hawaii-most-diverse-population-on-earth-says-abercrombie/">“Is it really true that Hawaii is the most diverse place on earth?”</a> Well that&#8217;s a myth that&#8217;s propagated here so is that really true? We&#8217;ll start that conversation. It&#8217;s really been a good feature for us and it&#8217;s been a very defining feature in the community. </p>
<p><strong>Today a significant number of people count twitter as their number one source of news. With such fast and tightly packaged stories filling the airwaves how do we tell a story that deserves more than 140 characters? Or deliver a video package that takes more than 3 minutes to do it justice?</strong></p>
<p>I think Twitter is not the way to do that. Twitter is a great tool for being like a nerve ending. Twitter&#8217;s strength is in immediacy, and speed. So use that tool for that. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the most powerful tool to drive eyeballs and interest, it&#8217;s a different type of tool. I think that Facebook is actually a much better way to distribute longer form pieces because it depends more on the endorsement of trusted friends and there&#8217;s an ability to see, in one place, the collective comments on a piece.</p>
<p>When we bemoan what&#8217;s happening with long form journalism, the reality is in some ways it&#8217;s so much better today because a single individual can produce something and share it. I think about the idea of getting a film shown in the past versus getting something shown today, it is completely different. There is a place for that nerve ending of Twitter and there&#8217;s a place for the long form. </p>
<p>Now how it gets supported financially that&#8217;s a whole other story. But there&#8217;s a question about how Twitter&#8217;s going to get supported financially too. The danger with short form is that it&#8217;s commoditized. You have to ask yourself what special advantage do you have in producing short form? It&#8217;s very hard to establish an advantage in that space I think. </p>
<p><strong>How do you know when you&#8217;ve been successful?</strong></p>
<p>One level of success no matter what other people think is did you treat your subjects respectfully and with integrity and honesty? If you didn&#8217;t, you’re not successful in my eyes. </p>
<p>One of the ways you know you&#8217;ve been successful is these people tell you that they learned something, that they see the world different, they appreciate what you&#8217;ve shared with them. But people could be very upset by something, and angry about it, and you still could have been very successful. So you don&#8217;t only want to judge success based on praise or positive response. Success may be that you&#8217;ve just told one hell of a story and people are really really unhappy about that story being made public. </p>
<p>You want to be really careful about focusing on success or failure and much more focused on the work itself and your own experience doing it. Try to learn from what you did and have some sense of independence and ask yourself what did you learn from the experience? And to me, that&#8217;s one level of success. Did you learn? Did you grow by telling the story? </p>
<p>So there are really many different kinds of success. People should be careful of judging success from external factors.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mediastorm.com/contributor/bruce-strong/607"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/195x245.jpg" alt="" title="Bruce Strong" width="195" height="245" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3567" /></a>MediaStorm is excited to announce that <a href="http://mediastorm.com/contributor/bruce-strong/607">Bruce Strong</a> will be joining us as our first Professional in Residence this fall. </p>
<p>Bruce is a multimedia storyteller who likes to work with cool people on awesome projects. Life is too short to do anything else. He has shot in nearly 60 countries, with Sudan and Liberia added to the mix most recently. Bruce was on staff at The Orange County Register in Southern California for 11 years and has freelanced for a variety of international publications and non-profit organizations. Bruce&#8217;s work has been published in such prestigious publications as TIME Magazine and National Geographic and has earned numerous awards and two fellowships—The Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellowship at the University of Michigan and the Knight Fellowship at Ohio University. </p>
<p>When he&#8217;s not on the field, Bruce spends a lot of time helping others learn to tell stories that matter. Currently, he&#8217;s an associate professor at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, where he teaches an array of video, audio, photography and multimedia courses. Teaching has been a rewarding and enlightening journey, and he is proud of his students, many of whom—while still students—have won top honors from NPPA, POY, World Press and BOP. He also had the good fortune of mentoring back-to-back College Photographer of the Year winners, Matt Eich and Travis Dove. Last year, Bruce was honored with a 2010 Meredith Teaching Recognition Award from Syracuse University and the National Press Photographers Association&#8217;s Robin F. Garland Educator Award. But Bruce is most proud of his two young sons, Jack and Cole, and loves adventuring through life with his visual journalist/professor wife, Claudia.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the last in our series of MediaStorm producers responding to the new FCP X. If you missed them, you can check out Eric Maierson&#8217;s thoughts <a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/2011/07/06/final-cut-pro-x-first-impressions-or-fcp-i-hope-you-feel-better-soon/">here</a>, and Tim McLaughlin&#8217;s <a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/2011/07/08/fcp-x-initial-reactions-2/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>FCP X, it was good while it lasted. </p>
<p>After working in FCP X for a week, I left on a Friday buoyed by the speed and efficiency at which the program runs. I had blazed through a weeks worth of work in just three days.</p>
<p>But on Monday morning, my work was gone.</p>
<p>I spent an hour on the phone with Apple. They asked me to run some tests. Several times I opened the project, made some changes, and closed it. Each time I reopened the file, it behaved differently. </p>
<p>Think Memento. </p>
<p>Sometimes the program “remembered” the changes correctly. Other times it reverted to a previously saved version. Other times it combined two previously saved versions to create a third!</p>
<p>The consultant on the phone sent my file to the engineers. He said they would analyze it and send me the prognosis in 48 hours. It’s over a week later, and I still haven’t heard back.</p>
<p>I’ve returned to FCP 7, but I can share my insights from a week of working with FCP X.</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong>
<ul>
<li>It’s speedy. I definitely noticed the difference in response time when I returned to FCP 7</li>
<li>Using keywords is a fast and easy way to organize your footage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong>
<ul>
<li>Synching more than two cameras using synching doesn’t work (I tried to synch three cameras with no luck. I also combined two cameras into a compound clip, and attempted to synch the third camera to this clip. Still, no luck)</li>
<li>FCP X crashes when editing multiple formats</li>
<li>Skimming is annoying when you don’t need it, and I didn’t find it very helpful when scanning for sound bites. You can, of course, just turn it off, but it would be great if you could actually use it to scan for bites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And the Ugly</strong>
<ul>
<li>Being able to save your work is 101.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it’s too early to predict the future, but after my experience I do not recommend using the program right now.</p>
<p><em><br />
In summary: as much as we all really wanted to love FCP X, it&#8217;s not usable for us in its current iteration. We&#8217;ve all reverted back to FCP 7 for now. We&#8217;re hoping that updates will make the program work for us in the not-too-distant future, but we&#8217;re also starting to look at other possible solutions should we need to make a switch. Right now, it&#8217;s really too early to make a decision. </p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to hear thoughts and impressions from all of you &#8211; are you making the switch, or sticking with FCP 7, or switching to an entirely new system? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://mediastorm.com/contributor/nacho-corbella/41">Nacho Corbella</a> is an award winning Multimedia Producer with several years of teaching experience and content gathering and editing for Multimedia, Print and Television productions. Today, he’s back in Chile teaching Multimedia Narratives, Photojournalism and Infographics in the Journalism School of Universidad de los Andes.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/corbella_photo.jpg"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/corbella_photo-300x300.jpg" alt="" title="Nacho Corbella" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3528" /></a><br />
<strong>Could you tell me a little bit about your background with photography and multimedia production?</strong></p>
<p>So I was a J student, basically. The only photo class that I had taken was an art photo class when I was an undergrad. Then I had this Multimedia project with <a href="http://knight.miami.edu/index.php/site/bios/rich_beckman">Rich Beckman</a> where I held a Digital SLR for the first time. That&#8217;s when I really grabbed that camera and made it mine, made her mine. I was shooting digital, it had just came out. It was the D30. I was just shooting and shooting, and editing and editing, and working with a ton of talented people. That was the best week of the class ever. A full week of getting constant feedback. That&#8217;s my photographic background basically. I just grabbed a camera for a whole week and just shot-shot-shot. I never left it. </p>
<p><strong>You produced a very moving piece titled, “Life After Foreclosure.” Could you walk us through your thought process while you were making that piece? What were your goals going and and what did you do to reach those goals? </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you how long it took me first. It was part of my thesis. I had a whole year basically to work on my thesis from my pre-production to shooting and everything. So I had this plan in mind, I was going to do this simple story thesis topic. Then the recession happened in 2007 and the whole market crashed. I watched TV, I would read the newspapers, I would read the magazines, and I wouldn&#8217;t see anyone&#8230; anyone. They were all just numbers. There were no people. I wanted to put a face on the crisis. </p>
<p>I think I have 700 emails that were sent in conversations trying to get people anywhere in the US. Constant phone calls, going to churches, going to foundations, going to whatever. Nothing would happen. Imagine every week how shitty you can feel when you try over and over to get somewhere. After almost six months I said, &#8220;Okay, if I don&#8217;t get anything by this Monday I&#8217;m done.” So Thursday afternoon I get this phone call from a friend telling me that there was this person that lives in Charlotte that was willing to talk and I was like, &#8220;Wow. Phone number? Name? Done. Thank you so much.&#8221; Hung up. Grabbed the phone. Lit up a cigarette and said, &#8220;Here it goes.&#8221; Called Cynthia, &#8220;Hi this is Nacho&#8230;&#8221; Same speech I always begin with. And she starts telling me her whole story. It was perfectly perfect. She was telling me the whole story and everything I needed. After 5 minutes she keeps telling me and she starts crying and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Shit, okay Cynthia. I&#8217;m really interested in your story. I&#8217;d love to meet you in person, if I can record an interview it would be great.” And she was like, “I would love to share this with you.” </p>
<p>Next morning I put everything in the car, drive all the way to Charlotte, three and a half hours, get there, opens the door&#8230; I&#8217;m in. I sit in, shoot the interview, we talk a little bit, shoot the interview. I go to a hotel and start transcribing my ideas, thinking about structure, all on the fly. </p>
<p>You have this preconceived idea, I had 3 and a half hours to think about it, but then when you get there&#8230; it&#8217;s their story not yours. The next morning I go back to Cynthia and knock on the door. 8am. She opens the door wearing her pajamas. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;re in. When the person you&#8217;re interviewing opens their door to you without caring that you’re going to be shooting with a camera and their hair is messed up, you know you&#8217;re in. Now I&#8217;m the only one that can fuck this up. So it&#8217;s all on me, and that&#8217;s the most beautiful feeling when you&#8217;re shooting a story. Because you know everything is there, you just need to do your job and do it well so you can actually portray what that person is sharing with you. </p>
<p>I can still remember she opened the door, pajamas, &#8220;come in.&#8221; That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s how I shaped that story. </p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14863992?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=2397d3" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How do you combine still photography and video to create a compelling narrative?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to quote MediaStorm here. You know how to do it. You know video is good for motion and you know stills are good for moments. And you know at the same time that you&#8217;re just one person. And if you want to do a real good job you have to focus on one or the other. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a constant battle. I know what I need is going to happen there and I&#8217;m always going to be carrying my camera, super light, I&#8217;ll be ready at 2.8. I don&#8217;t care about situation, I&#8217;ll just change the ISO. Go in and you can always have a small recorder on hand if you want to record something small. </p>
<p>You choose your battles. I&#8217;m going to go all-in with the video camera, I&#8217;m going to be a very ninja-tactical person with my photo camera and I&#8217;m going to pull it out whenever I need. You start balancing it. One of the best things that I could have done is put a camera strap on my video camera so I can have video camera on my right shoulder, still camera on my left shoulder, so whenever something happens I can shoot. </p>
<p><strong>You attended our 2009 Advanced Multimedia Workshop and helped produce the piece <a href="http://mediastorm.com/training/hold-out">“Hold Out.”</a> What were the biggest takeaway points from that workshop for you?</strong><br />
<a href="http://mediastorm.com/training/hold-out"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/w0006-768x432-300x168.jpg" alt="" title="Hold Out" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3529" /></a><br />
It&#8217;s just teamwork, that&#8217;s it. Teamwork. You know you can do it all. I know I&#8217;m not a great photographer, I&#8217;m not a great videographer, I&#8217;m not a great designer or anything. But I can put a story together well. And I know I could have done that story, but not at that angle at all. I had a kick-ass photographer, I had a kick-ass reporter. We had the people, which is the most important thing. It doesn&#8217;t matter how expensive your gear is, it&#8217;s just about the team.</p>
<p><strong>What motivates you to teach journalism and multimedia classes?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s something you love, you know? You want to share it. You want people to experience that. I want my students to experience the sensation I had when Cynthia opened that door wearing her pajamas. I want them to know that. I want them to open their eyes to the rest of the world. So teaching is just that. It&#8217;s like stepping point for them to open their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>For students that are just getting into multimedia work, what is a consistent bad habit that is important to get past?</strong></p>
<p>Technically: Use a frickin tripod for shooting. Also on the technical side, use a microphone. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get stuck on the technical either. Don&#8217;t forget, it&#8217;s not your story, it&#8217;s their story, and you&#8217;re just helping them tell that story. You can plan your shoots which will help you on the field if you&#8217;re not very comfortable, you can plan your questions which will help you a ton during the interview, but just don&#8217;t be like a horse race. You need to be looking around you. It&#8217;s not just about the technical, it&#8217;s not just about the questions, it&#8217;s about what&#8217;s the best way to tell this story.</p>
<p><strong>What about bad habits on the storytelling side?</strong></p>
<p>Your audience is going to be sitting in front of the computer having their meal, and your story is their meal. You need to sharpen those knives. Out of that big fat greasy piece of meat you need to make fillet. And that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to feed your audience, you&#8217;re going to feed them fillet. Take out all the stuff that is not necessary to tell that story in just a couple of minutes.  </p>
<p><strong>What issues do you see in the professional community?</strong></p>
<p>We just get too structured. We keep pushing the same thing over and over. And that&#8217;s great because we know it works. But you need to be a tourist in your own town. We&#8217;re loosing that surprise or amaze factor. Lazy, that&#8217;s the worst problem. I don&#8217;t care regardless of age, if you get lazy, you&#8217;re done. </p>
<p><strong>Do you think the solution is inspiration? Is energy the issue?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s an energy issue or not. I don&#8217;t know what the problem is, it&#8217;s just&#8230; you get stuck. You&#8217;re doing the same thing over and over again. And the minute you let something turn into a routine it&#8217;s something you do not enjoy. </p>
<p>I will buy little pieces of gear. I bought a suction cup, just for one little piece, &#8220;Roping the Wind.&#8221; In the jeep scene I put a suction cup on the tripod head. Those are little things that are going to make your story advance a little bit. You&#8217;ll feel like a kid again. And that&#8217;s key. I&#8217;m a big gadget fan, so for me it’s little things like a new wide angle lens, or this microphone, or this suction cup. That keeps me motivated when I shoot a new story. </p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14868842?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=2397d3" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Anything else?</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you find that little thing, that little thing you love you just go balls to the wall for it. And that&#8217;s what multimedia is, you’re just telling their story, you&#8217;re touching peoples hearts. Whenever you&#8217;re showing someone a story you did and you see emotion in their face, that&#8217;s it. If you see a smile, if you see a tear, if you see someone sad, that&#8217;s it. That story fulfilled something.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Press Photographers Association is pleased to announce the <a href="http://www.nppa.org/short_grants" target="_blank">2011 Short Grants program</a>, five grants of $3,000 each that will be awarded to support photojournalists who are creating compelling picture stories in their communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Budgets for newsrooms are shrinking and one of the greatest victims is the community photo story,&#8221; NPPA executive director Mindy Hutchison said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Photographers often don’t have the time or the funding that they used to have to work on compelling stories in their community. So NPPA is bringing back the community photo story project through the NPPA Short Grants, with five awards of $3,000 each. The grant is designed for funding projects small enough in scale that the bulk of the work can be accomplished in two weeks or less.&#8221;</p>
<p>NPPA&#8217;s Short Grants Program was made possible by funding received from the Authors Coalition of America (ACA), the organization which distributes royalties for overseas copying of works that cannot be identified by title or copyright owner. These funds must be used solely to support education and advocacy efforts benefitting photographers, Hutchison said.</p>
<p>Applications will be accepted through an online entry system. The entry period will begin on August 1, 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of NPPA&#8217;s primary goals is to support established photographers and encourage their growth,&#8221; Hutchison said. &#8220;The ACA funding has allowed us to continue our commitment to the advancement of visual journalists.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second in our series of MediaStorm producers responding to the new FCP X. If you missed the first response, from Eric Maierson, you can check that out <a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/2011/07/06/final-cut-pro-x-first-impressions-or-fcp-i-hope-you-feel-better-soon/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s amazing how much difference a day makes. </p>
<p>Yesterday I had prepared a blog post about my qualified, yet upbeat first impression of FCP X. </p>
<p>Of that blog post, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll include;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working in FCP X since it launched, and I&#8217;ve tried to approach it for what it is. A new piece of software that will have significant limitations, like all version 1 software. </p>
<p>In doing this, I&#8217;ve come to see the potential of the program. It&#8217;s a young buck, but as it matures, I think we&#8217;re going to be surprised at how robust it is. </p>
<p>Using metadata to organize and find assets is amazing. It&#8217;s fast and efficient. I&#8217;ve been able to organize content quicker than I was able to in FCP 7.  </p>
<p>Having access to my Aperture library&#8217;s organization within FCP X is a huge time saver. </p>
<p>Live previews of audio effects are great. Many of them can be controlled manually in the Inspector just as they were in Soundtrack Pro. </p>
<p>The Audition tool is amazing for trying out music and image edits. </p>
<p>Many of the editing quick keys are organized in a much more logical way. I&#8217;ve had to relearn nearly everything, but they&#8217;re generally pretty intuitive. </p>
<p>Other things that are big improvements include resolution independence, background rendering, and tapeless workflow.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of this is still true. But this morning FCP X scared the living daylights out of me. </p>
<p>Two of four producers in the office lost work when FCP X didn&#8217;t save properly. And for those of you haven&#8217;t opened the program, you should know that FCPX no longer has a manual save function; it&#8217;s all supposed to be done without so much as an Apple-S. </p>
<p>I can think of nothing more terrifying than feeling unsure of my ability to save work. This fact has spooked me to the core.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I&#8217;ve managed to crash the program several times by removing a keyword from a clip. One piece of metadata brought down the entire program. </p>
<p>And don&#8217;t plan on using native H.264 files. They make the entire program entirely too unstable.  </p>
<p>Now, I understand that this is new software and that it will get better with time. But the inability of this program to offer a stable environment for the most basic functions, like saving, has me thinking. </p>
<p>It took years for FCP 7 to become the type of program that even Walter Murch could edit on. Despite the advances in FCP X, Apple has asked us to again remain patient as they go down the path of building increased stability and functionality into their software, all while providing little to no information about the timeline they have for updates.   </p>
<p>While storytelling is software agnostic, time and money are not. </p>
<p>The prospect of waiting years for FCP X to mature is a depressing thought, and one that might not be financially viable for many institutions. I hope I&#8217;m wrong that it will take this long, but the point is, we just don&#8217;t know.<br />
  <br />
If you have the means, I&#8217;d list FCP X as a wait and learn. </p>

She was born in London and is based in Los Angeles, having worked as a photographer in Mexico City, Chile, and Northern Ireland.</em> </p>
<p><strong>You attended our <a href="http://mediastorm.com/train/workshops">Advanced Multimedia Workshop</a> in 2008 and produced <a href="http://mediastorm.com/training/one-man-brand">“One Man Brand.”</a> How has that workshop influenced your work since?</strong><br />
I think MediaStorm creates some of the best multimedia out there, so just picking up their way of doing things was valuable. There&#8217;s no one correct way to mix audio, stills and video for the web, so it was good to have people who really knew what they were doing give me a formula to start with. The course gave me a lot of confidence, and set a standard for me to emulate. I learn more every time I produce a multimedia project. </p>
<p><strong>Your piece “Homegirl cafe” was a 2011 Webby Awards honoree. How did you find the story?</strong><br />
I initially shot a photo essay on Homegirl Cafe at the request of our magazine desk. While I was there, I met Stephanie, and became interested in telling her story. I made some trips back on my own time to talk to her, and win her trust, and then shot the video interview and boxing footage. The piece was also nominated for multimedia at the Reuters internal annual journalist awards, which I hope will enable me to produce more projects.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/16189413?portrait=0&amp;color=2397d3" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What were the key things you were keeping in mind while you were producing the piece?</strong><br />
Telling a concise story from a long, sometimes rambling interview. Telling Stephanie&#8217;s story with compassion, and honestly portraying the fragile place in her life that she&#8217;s at &#8211; she could continue going straight, or fall back into the life she led before.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re producing your multimedia stories, do you typically work as a one-man-band or in a team? Do you do all of your own shooting and editing?</strong></p>
<p>I shot and edited on my own:<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/16189413">Homegirl Cafe</a><br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/15759818">Beijing Olympics 2008</a>. I shot video interviews and behind-the-scenes still photo sequences (you&#8217;re not allowed to shoot video footage at the Olympics if you&#8217;re not a rights holder), and put these together with Reuters photos from all the photographers at the Olympics.<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/15794160">Superbowl XLII</a></p>
<p>Collaborations:<br />
&#8211; I contributed a video and photo story about evictions to Reuters&#8217; <a href="http://widerimage.reuters.com/timesofcrisis/">Times of Crisis</a> multimedia package, along with other Reuters photographers. The project was produced by <strong>Ayperi Ecer</strong>, VP, Pictures &#038; <strong>Jassim Ahmad</strong>, Global Head of Multimedia &#038; Interactive Innovation at Reuters, and <strong>Bob Sacha</strong> &#038; <strong>Brian Storm</strong> at MediaStorm. Jassim, Bob and I made <a href="http://mediastorm.com/training/one-man-brand">&#8220;One Man Brand&#8221;</a> together at the MediaStorm workshop.<br />
Times of Crisis was nominated for an Emmy, and won Pictures of the Year International Documentary Project of the Year and NPPA multimedia package 1st place.<br />
&#8211; I shot video and stills about an <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/15796529">Afghanistan women&#8217;s shelter</a> for a multimedia package put together by online editor Jill Kitchener<br />
&#8211; I shot and edited <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/15826694">Route to Recovery</a> as part of a larger Reuters multimedia story (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/routetorecovery">http://www.reuters.com/routetorecovery</a>)<br />
&#8211; I shot video for a Reuters <a href="http://reut.rs/cuY6Jl">Insider TV</a> piece, produced by Laura Beatty for business visitors to LA</p>
<p><strong>Any tips or tricks you’ve found that help you when you’re working on deadline?</strong><br />
Most of the multimedia I&#8217;ve produced hasn&#8217;t been for a specific deadline. The lesson I need to learn once and for all is how much easier it is to get good, clean sound in the field, so I don&#8217;t have to spend a lot of time fixing it when I&#8217;m editing. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m usually pretty frustrated with myself when I listen to my interviews, and think of all the questions I should have been prompted to ask! I&#8217;m improving though, as I feel more comfortable with the process and the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have plans for another multimedia piece?</strong><br />
I really love producing multimedia, and hope I can do a lot more of it. I learn so much every time I have the chance to work on another piece, and I&#8217;m constantly on the lookout for stories that have multimedia potential. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set myself a personal goal to produce at least one a year (in between my busy day-to-day work!), and I&#8217;ve managed to do this every year since 2008. I feel lucky that my boss, <strong>Gary Hershorn</strong>, Reuters News Pictures Editor-North America, has been very supportive of this, and understands the value of more in-depth productions.</p>
<p>I try to start with photo essays and always take my audio recorder to interview people and record snatches of ambient sound. Often I&#8217;ll write text stories from these interviews for the Reuters Photographers Blog, and sometimes for the wire. Reuters has its own television and text departments, and those guys often accompany me on stories. So sometimes the multimedia is an online package of separate components produced by <strong>Corinne Perkins</strong> and the online desk, rather than a whole piece I produce myself.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>With the major changes in Apple&#8217;s new version of Final Cut Pro X, we&#8217;ve had a lot of people asking if MediaStorm is making the switch, and what we think of the program. This essay is the first in a series of MediaStorm producers responding to FCP X.</em></p>
<p>Apple giveth and Apple taketh away. And with the release of Final Cut Pro X, Apple did a lot of both.</p>
<p>Among the missing (at least for the moment):</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to import FCP 7 projects. </li>
<li>the ability to export only a portion of your project</li>
<li>multicam support</li>
<li>the auto-save vault</li>
</ul>
<p>And on and on.  </p>
<p>To be fair, Apple recently <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/faq" target="_blank">promised</a> to reintroduce absent functionality in future versions. It&#8217;s still painful to work with an incomplete toolset, particularly given that the toolset was doing pretty darn well just last week. Yes, FCP X is a 1.0 release but Apple is not new to this market. They&#8217;ve been shaping how we edit over the past 12 years of Final Cut Pro&#8217;s development. </p>
<p>What Apple has given us is a reinterpretation of the editing metaphor. Organization is now based on metadata, not bins. The Timeline allows for clip connections so that chunks of your project move together, dynamically, as a way to avoid inadvertent collisions. Only one sequence is allowed per project. There are ways around that, but, to be sure, it&#8217;s a whole new game. And at the moment, Final Cut X is still too awkward and clunky to play big-time ball. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><em>1</em></a></p>
<p>In the end, I hope that FCP X will make editing easier. But that&#8217;s certainly not the case right now. And that&#8217;s the crux of my complaint. FCP X (pronounced &#8220;ten&#8221;) leapfrogged over the previous version, which was No. 7. Missing in action are FCP 8 and 9. That&#8217;s significant. </p>
<p>Instead of a transition–a continuation of the Final Cut Pro story, if you will–Apple redefined the narrative without preparing editors. As blogger and editor <a href="http://lonelysandwich.com/post/7033868135/fcp-the-new-class" target="_blank">Adam Lisagor</a> noted, it&#8217;s like Apple is a TV network that suddenly decided you&#8217;d be better off without the main characters you&#8217;ve been following closely for more than a decade. No warning, no nothing. One day they just decided, <em>Those old folks, don&#8217;t worry about where they went, you just pay attention to these the new, hip youngsters and everything will be fine.  <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></em></p>
<p>Apple does what Apple does. And most of the time, despite early protests like this one, we come to appreciate the rightness of their decisions. From the iPod to OSX, examples abound. A year from now, let&#8217;s hope we can say the same about Final Cut Pro X, but right now I can&#8217;t recommend using the program.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Initially, I had a more tempered response. Then, I tried outputing audio only and received a frustrating number of &#8220;fatal errors.&#8221; But that&#8217;s nothing compared to the two day&#8217;s of work Tim lost. </p>
<li id="fn:2">Apple has not only stopped selling FCP 7, they&#8217;ve begun to pull it from the shelves of retailers, too.
</ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><strong>This interview is the first of a series we will be conducting with former workshop attendees. The interviews are intended to gain insight into how these creative professionals approach their work and bring out the story in their subjects.</strong></div>
<p><a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rm_close.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3364" title="Ricky Montalvo" src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rm_close-223x300.png" alt="" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<div><em><a href="http://mediastorm.com/contributor/ricky-montalvo/92">Ricky Montalvo</a> is a video producer for Yahoo! Studios and is based in San Francisco. Ricky is one of the few &#8220;one man shows&#8221; within the Yahoo! Studios group, where he shoots, edits and often produces content that runs throughout Yahoo!&#8217;s online network.</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><strong>You started out at Yahoo! working in project management and sales, and then decided to make a career change to video production. What sparked the change?</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div>
<p>Part of it was a passion for filmmaking in general. But I never went to school for that, so obviously trying to break into that industry proves somewhat tough. I decided to leave Yahoo and take some time off. I had been there for seven years, which in internet time, is a lot, it&#8217;s like dog years. So I took some time off, travelled, lived in Munich. Then I came back and started enrolling in courses through City College in San Francisco, the Bay Area Video Coalition. I started doing my own little side projects. What I realized was that fictional filmmaking was nice, but what I really love is telling stories. I just got a call one day, and it was the guy who I report to now, and he said, &#8220;I heard you&#8217;re doing this freelance stuff. We&#8217;re looking for a video producer, would you like to come on board?&#8221; I got really lucky.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve mentioned that you’ve attended a lot of workshops and continue to do so to help improve your production skills. Can you talk about how the <a href="http://mediastorm.com/train/workshops">MediaStorm workshop</a> has been part of your development?</strong></p>
<p>What I learned is that stories can breathe. Listening to the audio and determining how what you&#8217;re hearing and what you’re seeing tie together so that the story breathes. And by ‘breathing’ I mean you <em>feel</em> what is being said and what&#8217;s being shown, as opposed to being <em>told</em> what&#8217;s being said and what&#8217;s being shown. That was an eye-opener for me.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do to let a story breathe?</strong></p>
<p>It depends, I think a lot of people think it&#8217;s about pacing. The person says something and you just hold that for a second. I think for me though it&#8217;s in how I capture the visuals. When someone is talking I always incorporate a dolly shot that just sort of flows with what the person is saying, or a jib shot to just hover around the person. I try to avoid the typical news stuff like panning and tilting. I just cringe on those shots. It&#8217;s not just pacing, it&#8217;s more in the visuals.</p>
<p>The thing that Brian Storm said that I&#8217;ll never forget was, &#8220;Why should I care?&#8221; And that definitely resonates to this day. In features you just get as much as you can as quickly as you can. Why am I getting this shot? Am I getting this shot because I&#8217;m just getting it or because it&#8217;s making a difference in the story? In the back of my mind I always hear Brian say, &#8220;Why should I care?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In the <a href="http://mediastorm.com/train/workshops">Advanced Multimedia Workshop</a> you’re paired up with other media professionals to produce a piece. What was that collaborative process like for you?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that I thought going into the MediaStorm workshop was that I was going to be way under-qualified, because the two people that were on my team were an AP photog, <a href="http://mediastorm.com/contributor/evan-vucci/125">Evan Vucci</a>, and a photo editor, <a href="http://mediastorm.com/contributor/bernadette-tuazon/123">Bernadette Tuazon</a>. So I thought, oh my gosh, I&#8217;m going to bring absolutely nothing to the table. But when you collaborate on something you realize, as a team, you all bring something to the table and each person has something the other doesn&#8217;t and you need to feed off that. I was really good at video, and not so good at photography. These guys, they knew photography, so it was such a good mix. Learning from each other is just as important as learning from the workshop itself.</p>
<p><strong>In your workshop group you helped produce the piece, <a href="http://mediastorm.com/training/an-apollo-legend">“An Apollo Legend.”</a> What were the big takeaway points from telling that story?</strong></p>
<p>I think that my biggest key takeaway was how you have one idea for a story, and then you end up finding something completely different. We wanted to portray it as the first American Idol, or the first You&#8217;ve Got Talent, or You Can Dance. Essentially, the Apollo Theater is that. No one thinks about it because all these shows like American Idol are very popular. We were going to try to make that story, but what we found in our subjects was that they themselves were the story. And that was the key takeaway. You can tell a story when there&#8217;s good contrast. Not antagonist or protagonist, but just people keep doing the same thing with different outcomes regardless. So we got really lucky. We went in with one idea, and we came out with a different one altogether.</p>
<p><strong>One of your current projects is Yahoo!’s Second Act video series. In the season two opener we meet Ernestine Shepherd. Can you tell us a little bit about her and her story?</strong></p>
<p>I work with two producers, and they do a really good job of scouring magazines, newspaper articles, the internet, trying to find stories that are unique. We find something like 15, 20 stories &#8211; once we make a few phone calls that becomes 4 or 5. Once you hear them tell their story you&#8217;re going to know whether or not it’s going to translate on video, and she was definitely was one of them. The way she speaks, she speaks like a grandmother, but she looks like she&#8217;s someone&#8217;s sister. She&#8217;s definitely fit. It was a no-brainer to shoot her. One thing we were concerned about was, how are we going to capture the visuals, close ups of her body, we were always trying to figure out what the shot was going to look like. The idea is, there is grace and beauty in what she does and that&#8217;s what we were trying to convey.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/24964260?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=2397d3" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Any tips or advice you’d offer to people getting started in multimedia?</strong></p>
<p>Make mistakes. I think that&#8217;s the best way to learn. There are going to times when you don&#8217;t hit record, the audio is going to be bad, and I guarantee you won&#8217;t do it again. So don&#8217;t be afraid to make mistakes. The second thing is, practice. You shouldn&#8217;t wait for the next story to try something new &#8211; you should go try it. Interview your significant other, put together a day-in-the-life-of, so the next time you get a story, you&#8217;re prepared. And I guess the third thing is don&#8217;t be afraid of technology because it&#8217;s not going anywhere. You&#8217;re going to have to learn it otherwise the bus is going to drive by.</p>

Full information is below. You can <a href="http://www.theaftermathproject.org/pdf/conflictgrantapplication.pdf">download the application form</a> from their website.  Deadline is October 1, 2011.</em></p>
<p>Dear friends –</p>
<p>I’m writing with news of a special grant cycle that’s a bit of a departure for the Aftermath Project – a grant that is open only to conflict photographers.</p>
<p>As many of you know, the Aftermath Project was created to help photographers cover the aftermath of conflict, and was founded on the understanding that war is only half the story. But for quite some time I’ve been thinking about how the Aftermath Project could engage more meaningfully with conflict photographers – who, after all, are the ones telling the first half of the story.</p>
<p>When Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros were killed, I found myself listening to the conversations and reading the postings that poured out from photographers and colleagues about the incredible sense of loss we all felt, and also about the many costs of covering conflict. It occurred to me that it might be the right time to offer a grant for conflict photographers who wanted to engage in a conversation about aftermath.</p>
<p>It is a testament to how deeply moved people were by the loss of Tim and Chris that I was able to raise $16,000 in the first 72 hours after I asked a handful of people to support this grant, people who had never even met Tim and Chris. Another $4,000 quickly followed, bringing the total to $20,000.</p>
<p>And so we are able to offer this year-long grant to conflict photographers who want to pursue a project about the aftermath in their own lives of covering conflict. The subject can be approached in any way – portraits, landscapes, reportage, collaboration with a family of someone who has been killed, anything that explores the personal aftermath of covering war, whether that be PTSD, the aftermath of sexual assault, the aftermath of being wounded. This is a very open and fluid call for proposals on this subject, and we welcome any and all approaches. We are very interested in supporting a dialogue about this kind of aftermath – both for the photographer who wins the grant, and for the broader audience who we hope will engage with the work when the grant winner’s year is finished.</p>
<p>I’m also very pleased to announce a special $5,000 honorarium for a fixer or translator, who has worked with a conflict photographer, and who wants to tell a story (written or visual) about their own aftermath experience. Although the Aftermath Project’s mission is to give grants to photographers, we agree with many people in the photo community who have strongly voiced their concerns about the lack of attention paid to the great costs paid by fixers and translators, whose own lives – and all too often deaths – go unnoticed and uncared for. Thanks to the commitment of one donor – a photographer – we are able to offer this modest honorarium in the hope that it will help spur further action by others.</p>
<p>One important note: if a conflict photographer AND a fixer/translator wish to apply together, they will be eligible for the combined sums of $25,000.</p>
<p>The application requirements are very simple. Please see <a href="http://www.theaftermathproject.org/pdf/conflictgrantapplication.pdf">the application form</a>.</p>
<p>I also want to thank and acknowledge the generous support of the individuals who have made this possible:</p>
<p>Grant donors: Joan Morgenstern, Martha Kellner, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, Chris Meledandri,<br />
Betsy Karel and Neal Baer.</p>
<p>Honorarium donor: Elizabeth Rappaport.</p>
<p>Special thanks, too, to our friends at LOOK3 &#8212; where we first announced this grant earlier this month.</p>
<p>With warm regards,<br />
Sara Terry, Director/Founder</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most powerful talks that I attended during the <a href="http://look3.org/">LOOK</a><a href="http://look3.org/">3</a> festival in Charlottesville this year was given by <a href="http://look3.org/events/ashley-gilbertson/">Ashley Gilbertson</a>. Gilbertson presented his latest project titled, “Bedrooms of the Fallen.” The project consists of a series of pictures of the dormant bedrooms left by soldiers who died at war. Gilbertson explained that he had become frustrated by the public’s lack of response to his photographs coming out of Iraq that depicted the violence surrounding him and the soldiers assigned to protect him.</p>
<p>It was moving to hear him talk about the soldiers in his pictures, and in many cases, explain how they were killed. His wife suggested that he photograph their bedrooms as a way for people to relate to their lives. Since then, Gilbertson has photographed dozens of bedrooms across the US and Europe. In many cases, the rooms are arranged in the exact same way as the day the soldier left, except for the occasional folded flag to remind us of why the room is vacant.</p>
<p>Just as Gilbertson was describing how viewers can relate better to loss through these images, a picture of the bedroom belonging to <a href="http://www.bedroomsofthefallen.com/bedrooms/detail.html#/langenbrunner_richard ">PFC. Richard P. Langenbrunner</a> of Fort Wayne, Indiana appeared. I immediately recognized a poster on the wall from the movie “The Matrix” and realized I have the same poster on my own wall. The room immediately became far more personal to me and I felt like I knew more about this soldier through this photograph than any description in a newspaper article could provide.</p>

<p>The MediaStorm crew got back from the <a href="http://look3.org/">LOOK3</a> Festival of the Photograph a little over a week ago and we’re still processing the amazing experience we had! LOOK3 is hosted in Charlottesville, Virginia and gathers photographers from across the country and around the world. As a new intern with MediaStorm, it was quite a way to start the summer!</p>
<div id="attachment_3315" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/MediaStorm_Look3-e1308778544726.jpg"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/MediaStorm_Look3-e1308778544726.jpg" alt="" title="MediaStorm_Look3" width="500" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-3315" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From left to right: Tim McLaughlin, Pam Huling, Eric Maierson, Matthew McAllister, Jacky Myint, Rick Gershon, Lauren Rosenfeld, Leandro Badalotti, Jessica Stuart, Brian Storm, Tim Klimowicz</p></div>
<p>Speakers included <a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-antonin-kratochvil/">Antonin</a><a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-antonin-kratochvil/"> </a><a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-antonin-kratochvil/">Kratochvil</a>, <a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-massimo-vitali/">Massimo</a><a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-massimo-vitali/"> </a><a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-massimo-vitali/">Vitali</a>, <a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-nan-goldin/">Sally Mann and Na</a><a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-nan-goldin/">n </a><a href="http://look3.org/events/insight-artist-nan-goldin/">Goldin</a>. Additional talks covered a wide range of topics from a discussion with <a href="http://look3.org/events/steve-mccurry/">Steve McCurry</a> on how he got the now infamous National Geographic cover photo of Sharbat Gula, to the showing of a video piece about high school Proms by <a href="http://look3.org/events/film-prom/">Martin Bell and Mary Ellen Mark</a>. Everyone walked away from each and every session inspired and in awe of the work people were doing.</p>
<p>What struck me was that even though this entire festival was about photography, the equipment and gear people used to make these amazing pieces was the last thing they talked about. All of the artists care deeply about their work and the subjects they photograph, and it is this passion that comes through the image and makes it amazing art.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund unveiled its newly revamped Website today at <a href="http://www.smithfund.org" target="_blank">www.smithfund.org</a>.<br />
<a href="http://mediastorm.com/clients/smithfund-website-for-w-eugene-smith-memorial-fund" target="_blank"><img src="http://mediastorm.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/c0049-950-e1306943520260.jpg" alt="" title="Smith Fund" width="500" height="442" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3247" /></a><br />
The portal, redesigned by MediaStorm — incorporating the <a href="http://mediastorm.com/player">MediaStorm Player</a> — provides an expanded selection of work from the 33 past recipients of the grant as well as easier site navigation, streamlined online registration for grant applicants, and thumbnail histories of photojournalist W. Eugene Smith, the fund itself, and the Howard Chapnick grant. (<strong>The deadline for the 2011 grant has been extended to Friday, June 3rd.</strong>)</p>
<p>The W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography&#8211;considered by many to be the most prestigious, long-standing honorarium for completion of a photojournalistic project&#8211;was created in 1979, a year after Smith’s death. The grant’s mission is to support and encourage photographers producing humanistic photo stories in the tradition of the legendary American photo essayist who sought to expose the truth about issues affecting and afflicting humankind. Between 1980 and 2010, the fund issued grants to 33 recipients from 14 countries, including photographers who were honored at pivotal points in their careers: Jane Evelyn Atwood, Donna Ferrato, Brenda Ann Kenneally, Graciela Iturbide, James Nachtwey, Trent Parke, Paolo Pellegrin, Gilles Peress, Eugene Richards, Cristina Garcia Rodero, and Sebastiao Salgado. The fund occasionally issues fellowships to promising projects as part of the judging process for the grant.</p>
<p>Judging for the 2011 grant will commence later this month. The jury will meet a second time in July. The grant ceremony will take place in New York in October.</p>
<p>The W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund is sponsored by the generous support of the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP), MediaStorm, the Open Society Foundations (OSF), Photo District News (PDN), Blurb, Inc., Canon USA, and Asia Society.</p>

The Libyan desert near Ras Lanouf<br />
March, 2011</p>
<p>Demonstrations have given way to bloody conflict. Battle lines sway back and forth as the Benghazi-centered ragtag rebels combat Tripoli&#8217;s mercenaries and loyalists. Pro-Gaddafi forces mount their first coordinated offensive, exposing the rebels as woefully untrained and unorganized. Defiance turns to anguish when casualties mount. Slivers of hope rest on defecting army generals and foreign intervention.</p>
<p>Photojournalist Patrick Chauvel brings us this immersive video from the rebels&#8217; front lines. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very sad story,&#8221; he says. &#8220;These guys are students, they&#8217;re hairdressers, they&#8217;re bakers, bankers, philosophers, teachers. They are no military.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chauvel is concerned for his safety. Gaddafi loyalists target the media and could cut off any escape. Four New York Times journalists are missing at the time and an Al Jazeera cameraman dies in the days that follow. Patrick says fighting in the flat, open desert divides the rebels into two camps: lucky and unlucky. Shelling hits at random, missing by hundreds of meters one moment and striking a direct hit the next. Chauvel fears the misses are the warning shots. He plans to escape before the battle becomes a massacre.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of applying for <a href="http://www.kalishworkshop.org/" target="_blank">The Kalish Workshop</a>, the Workshop and the NPPA are offering some great stipends and scholarships:</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.nppa.org/news_and_events/news/2011/04/kalish.html" target-"_blank">NPPA site</a>:<br />
The National Press Photographers Association is offering two full-tuition scholarships to The Kalish Workshop in June at Ball State University in Muncie, IN, and the workshop is offering 10 stipends toward registration.</p>
<p>The Kalish, in its twenty-first year, is four days of intense training in visual storytelling editing. Participants will learn how to establish a narrative, select media mix, edit the narrative, and produce the story for online and print. The Kalish combines lectures, hands-on exercises, critiques, and group discussions to create a complete learning experience. The workshop is geared for anyone who handles pictures for online or print. Picture editors, photographers, professors, writers, and designers will benefit. The workshop at Ball State will run from June 20 through June 24, 2011.</p>
<p>To be eligible for this scholarship, you must reside in the United States and make your living primarily through still photography. Please include a statement verifying that your work has been published by a publisher and is reasonably capable of being reprographically reproduced (i.e. photocopied) abroad, or your work has been commercially distributed by a licensee or a manufacturer in a form reasonably capable of being reprographically reproduced abroad.</p>
<p>To apply, please send an email of 300 words or less to Danny Gawlowski at <a href="mailto: dgawlowski@seattletimes.com">dgawlowski@seattletimes.com</a>. In your email please explain why you want to attend The Kalish. <strong>The deadline for applying is Monday, May 2, 2011.</strong></p>
<p>Also, The Kalish is offering ten $150 stipends toward registration based on need. These selections will be made in early May. If you have already applied, you will be included in the selection process. The workshop application can be found online here. These stipends are independent of the NPPA scholarships.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 1 at 7:30pm $9 suggested donation.</p>
<p>Artists Florian Thalhofer, Fred Ritchin, and Jonathan Harris present for discussion along with curators Hanne-Lovise Skartveit and André Valentim Almeida.</p>
<p>Documentary filmmakers are seizing the opportunity to use emerging technologies and expand their linear films into digital platforms to engage with audiences in new ways. In this panel, meet three of the most exciting experts on the subject who have cultivated and perfected the interactive, digital form as their primary way of representing reality: Berlin-based media artist <a href="http://www.thalhofer.com/" target="_blank">Florian Thalhofer</a>, maker of online documentaries and the creator of the Korsakow System -a leading software for the creation of nonlinear documentaries-; <a href="http://www.number27.org/" target="_blank">Jonathan Harris</a>, award winning artist behind the We Feel Fine project with a mission to find ways for technology to deepen our understanding of ourselves and our lives; and <a href="http://www.pixelpress.org/fredritchin.html" target="_blank">Fred Ritchin</a>, Professor at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, author of After Photography, and director of PixelPress. The panel will be moderated by Hanne-Lovise Skartveit, film producer with a PhD on Interactive and Hybrid documentary forms. The panel will explore different forms of “Interactive Documentary”, show examples, and discuss the possibilities and limits of the formats, including funding, audiences and distribution. An event curated by Andre Valentim Almeida and Hanne-Lovise Skartveit.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2011 W. Eugene Smith Grant for Humanistic Photography is now open for entries. The deadline for the receipt of applications is May 31, 2011. Photographers interested in applying may obtain guidelines at the <a href="http://www.smithfund.org/public/apply/smith" target="_blank">W. Eugene Smith Fund website</a>.</p>
<p>For 2011, the amount of the grant will be $30,000. An additional $5,000 in fellowship money will be dispersed, at the discretion of the jury, to one or more finalists deemed worthy of special recognition. Grants will be presented in a ceremony held in New York City in October.</p>
<p>The W. Eugene Smith Grant for Humanistic Photography was established in 1979 following the death of Gene Smith, the legendary American photo essayist. Today, the grant represents the most prestigious honor in the field of documentary photography. </p>
<p><strong>The Judging:</strong><br />
Every year, the fund&#8217;s board of trustees appoints a three-member international jury to recognize a photographer who has demonstrated an exemplary commitment to documenting the human condition in the spirit of Smith&#8217;s humanistic photography and his compassionate dedication. The jury meets twice. </p>
<p><strong>To Apply:</strong><br />
Applicants in the process of producing or completing a project in the tradition of W. Eugene Smith’s humanistic photography should include a written proposal that is concise, journalistically realizable, visually translatable, and humanistically driven, plus a resumé of educational and professional qualifications. Additionally, applicants must demonstrate evidence of their photographic ability and submit between 20 and 40 images. </p>
<p>The grant recipient must affirm that the proposed project is ongoing.</p>
<p>For an <a href="http://www.smithfund.org/public/apply/smith" target="_blank">application form</a> or more information about the W. Eugene Smith Memorial Fund, visit their website at <a href="http://smithfund.org" target="_blank">http://smithfund.org</a></p>
