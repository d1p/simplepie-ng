            <title>A Modern Front-Porch Campaign?</title>
            <description>New York Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox tells &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1011/For_Christie_a_modern_frontporch_campaign_.html?showall"&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) should run a modern "&lt;a href="http://politicaldictionary.com/words/front-porch-campaign/"&gt;front-porch campaign&lt;/a&gt;" for president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Said Cox: "He just cannot desert his job in New Jersey. He's a recently-elected governor with a Democratic legislature on which he's trying hard to impose fiscal discipline. That's the success on which his campaign rests."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


Instead, Christie's campaign would consist of "large-scale policy addresses like his speech at the Reagan Library last week, of participation in debates, and of a basic ground organization -- but none of the immersive early-state retail campaigning that's widely seen as a necessity."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Advertising would be handled by a completely independent committee without fundraising restrictions.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/8z2tmKruCog" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Perry Critics Say He's No Racist</title>
            <description>Even though Rick Perry is still on the defensive about yesterday's &lt;a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2011/10/02/rick_perrys_niggerhead.html"&gt;explosive report&lt;/a&gt; on the name of his family's hunting camp, the &lt;a href="http://www.texastribune.org/texas-politics/2012-presidential-election/perrys-critics-say-hes-no-racist/"&gt;Texas Tribune&lt;/a&gt; reports that even some of Perry's fiercest critics "say they do not believe he is racist." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"They point to his record of appointments as evidence: He appointed the state's first African-American state supreme court justice, Wallace Jefferson, and later made him chief justice. (Jefferson's great grandfather was a slave, 'sold like a horse,' Perry once said with disgust.) Perry's former general counsel and former chief of staff, Brian Newby, is black; so is Albert Hawkins, the former Health and Human Services Commissioner who Perry handpicked to lead the massive agency in 2002."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Indeed, in his 11-year gubernatorial tenure, Perry has appointed more minorities to statewide posts -- including university regents and secretaries of state -- than any governor in Texas history."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/DkW7UQr_qtU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Primary Calendar Comes Into Focus</title>
            <description>Florida's &lt;a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2011/09/30/florida_primary_moved_up.html"&gt;bump up&lt;/a&gt; of its primary to January 31 has started the chain reaction expected. &lt;a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/03/south-carolina-to-hold-primary-on-january-21/"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports South Carolina's GOP primary will now be held on January 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Iowa caucuses would likely be in the first week of January, followed by the New Hampshire primary eight days later and the Nevada caucuses four days after that.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/NT4JlcvfKhs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Too Close to Call in West Virginia</title>
            <description>A new &lt;a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/10/west-virginia-too-close-to-call.html"&gt;Public Policy Polling survey&lt;/a&gt; in West Virginia finds the special election for governor this week to be a toss up. Acting Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin (D) barely leads Bill Maloney (R), 47% to 46%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Last month, Tomblin's lead was six points and he had led by as large a margin as 33 points earlier in the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"It looks like this race could go either way tomorrow.  Maloney's biggest enemy might be the clock -- given the overwhelming momentum he's had another month and you have to think he would almost definitely pull out this race.  But Tomblin may yet be able to hang on by the skin of his teeth."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/IK0fLam-WFo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Most Don't Know What "GOP" Means</title>
            <description>A new &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2011/11/60-minutes-poll-201111"&gt;60 Minutes/Vanity Fair poll&lt;/a&gt; finds that just 45% of Americans overall correctly identify the meaning of "GOP" as Grand Old Party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The second most popular choice, with 35% of the overall vote, was "Government of the People." "Grumpy Old People" received 7% of the vote, "God's Own Party" 3%, and 1% thought the abbreviation stood for "Gauntlet of Power." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/61EDprOMFAA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Obama to Use Bush Playbook</title>
            <description>"The last time an incumbent president faced re-election, George W. Bush exploited social and national security issues to offset his economic vulnerabilities. Over the next year, President Obama will try the same thing," the &lt;a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/obama-campaign-borrows-from-bush-04-playbook/"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reports.
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 

"In important electoral battlegrounds, Mr. Obama's strategists intend to use abortion, gay rights, the environment and successes in the fight against Al Qaeda to counter economic attacks and drive a wedge between Republicans and swing voters."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/_DAWJwSKPE4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bachmann Hasn't Voted Since August 1</title>
            <description>Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) has voted only 54% of the time since announcing her presidential bid June 13 -- missing 150 votes and every vote during the month of September, according to data compiled by &lt;a href="http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_35/Michele-Bachmann-Ron-Paul-Have-Truancy-Problems-209097-1.html"&gt;Congressional Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In fact, the last time Bachmann voted was August 1 -- a "no" vote on the debt ceiling deal.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/Iqj3t4IAy7o" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Perry Lured Subprime Lenders</title>
            <description>Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) "spent tens of millions in taxpayer money to lure some of the nation's leading mortgage companies to expand their business in his state, calling it a national model for creating jobs. But the plan backfired," the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iiElzQAhVEZQoWMscaG97zME1OqQ?docId=9794c1a2c15c42fab8a36c7db89aaf28"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Just as the largest banks began receiving public cash, they aggressively ramped up risky lending. Within four years, the banks were out of business and homeowners across Texas faced foreclosure. In the end, the state paid $35 million to subsidize it."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"An Associated Press review of federal mortgage data, court filings and public statements found that Perry downplayed early warnings of an impending mortgage crisis as alarmist."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/fh4-sOp00XA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Eric Cantor, Unloved</title>
            <description>&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/eric-cantor-2011-10/"&gt;Jason Zengerle&lt;/a&gt; profiles House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) noting that no one "has done more to disrupt Obama's first term -- and threaten his chance at a second -- than Cantor. The two men have clashed from the start."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

He's consolidated his own power by courting the Republican House freshmen who gave his party the majority in last year's elections. "Some veteran GOP lawmakers find Cantor's coddling of the freshmen irritating... But Cantor has realized that, in Washington these days, being liked is not a substantial advantage. Much better to be deemed so unreasonable that your opponents ultimately feel no choice but to bend to your will."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Also interesting: "And yet for all the loyalty many GOP congressmen feel toward Cantor, he
 is surprisingly unloved. Even his admirers say he lacks the social ease
 and natural confidence of most politicians... Cantor rarely socializes 
with his colleagues, and since he doesn't golf or fish or have any 
hobbies, when he does find himself in social situations, he usually 
talks about work."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/KurHFFYDMn0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Christie Has Less Experience Than Obama Did</title>
            <description>&lt;a href="http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/article/crazy-math-chris-christie-candidacy"&gt;Byron York&lt;/a&gt; notes that on October 10, Chris Christie "will have been governor for 629 days. When Barack Obama announced his presidential candidacy on February 10, 2007, he had been a U.S. senator for 768 days.  Yes, Obama -- derided by Republicans for his lack of experience -- had been a senator longer than Christie has been a governor."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/2WTqetG6LGU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Solo Shopping Trip or Staged Photo Op?</title>
            <description>Neither the White House nor the Associated Press will say how an AP photographer came to be the only news photographer present at a Target store in Virginia to capture First Lady Michelle Obama's shopping excursion last week, the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/michelle-obamas-target-trip-critics-take-aim/2011/10/02/gIQATrMLGL_story.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It is "uncommon, and perhaps unprecedented, for a single news organization to record such a trip," so many are asking, "Was it just an innocent shopping trip, a chance to escape the White House bubble or a clever bit of image manipulation?"&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/ZIj__dn_shU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>How One Man Took Control of North Carolina</title>
            <description>The &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_mayer"&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; looks at the effects the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling striking down limits on corporate spending in campaigns has had on North Carolina, and finds that conservative businessman Art Pope has achieved enormous influence in the state. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pope helped flip the state's legislature from Democratic to Republican, and he is poised to exert huge influence in the 2012 Presidential election -- in a state that most experts say President Obama must carry in order to be re-elected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"For years, Pope, like several other farsighted conservative corporate activists, has been spending millions in an attempt to change the direction of American politics." Now, with the Citizens United ruling, in swing states like North Carolina "an individual donor, particularly one with access to corporate funds, can play a significant, and sometimes decisive, role."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/B_uRch0JANc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>New Voting Restrictions May Affect 5 Million Voters</title>
            <description>A &lt;a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/study_new_voting_restrictions_may_affect_more_than_five_million"&gt;Brennan Center study&lt;/a&gt; finds 19 recently passed voting laws in 14 states could make it significantly harder for more than five million eligible voters to cast ballots in 2012, leading to "significant electoral impact in next year's hard-fought races."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 

"The states that have already cut back on voting rights will provide 171 electoral votes in 2012 -- 63% of the 270 needed to win the presidency."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 

Minorities, poor and young voters will likely be most affected.

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 

"Internal company documents show that the company made those sales through foreign subsidiaries, thwarting a U.S. trade ban. Koch Industries units have also rigged prices with competitors, lied to regulators and repeatedly run afoul of environmental regulations, resulting in five criminal convictions since 1999 in the U.S. and Canada."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One employee "who testified against the
company said he and his colleagues were shown by their managers
how to steal and cheat -- using techniques they called the Koch
Method."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/beHqQxYJz7c" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <description>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) is staying away from news reporters as he mulls making a presidential bid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

At an event today, the &lt;a href="http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/amid-white-house-rumors-christie-meets-nj-guard-20111002-apx#.Tojg3Wl1fcs.twitter"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; reports "two dozen national and local news reporters were escorted to a roped-off area 50 feet away from the stage where Christie spoke. The usually talkative Christie left the event without talking to the press, who were not allowed to leave until after he was out of sight. National Guard soldiers were instructed to kept media and all attendees cordoned off as Christie exited."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/10/02/christie-stays-mum-on-2012-run-at-n-j-national-guard-event/"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;: "Guards could be overheard telling each other to make sure the press are blocked from pursuing the governor when he leaves."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/Jo8hOk8-eek" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>The White House That Couldn't</title>
            <description>Despite its faults, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/books/review/confidence-men-by-ron-suskind-book-review.html?ref=books"&gt;Joe Nocera&lt;/a&gt; says Ron Suskind's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061429252/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=youwonnowwhat&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061429252"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confidence Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is "tough-minded in its assessment of the men (and they were all men) whose advice the president listened to when he first took office; penetrating in its analysis of why the administration's approach to the country's economic ills has been so lackluster; and ruthless in its judgment of Barack Obama himself, who Suskind bluntly says 'wasn't ready' to be president, so deficient in even the most rudimentary leadership skills that it took him over a year to realize that his White House was in chaos."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Almost in spite of itself, &lt;em&gt;Confidence Men&lt;/em&gt; is an important addition to 
the growing library of books about this president. It tells you things --

            <title>House Republicans Nervous</title>
            <description>House Republicans "return to Washington this week a restless bunch in the wake of an embarrassing legislative defeat and months before they face primary voters in the 2012 election," &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/184977-restless-house-gop-members-pointing-fingers-at-one-another"&gt;The Hill&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"The stunning downfall of a stopgap spending bill, which 48 Republicans rejected on Sept. 21, is a clear sign that managing the House GOP Conference in the coming months will be extremely challenging. While House Republicans were able to pass a second spending bill with only 24 defections, the flawed strategy of moving the first piece of legislation has left some battle scars."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Also producing anxiety: Redistricting pitting incumbents versus incumbents, coupled with the threat of Tea Party primary opponents.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/I0T6JEOCO2o" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Rick Perry's "Niggerhead"</title>
            <description>&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-perry-familys-hunting-camp-still-known-to-many-by-old-racially-charged-name/2011/10/01/gIQAOhY5DL_story.html?hpid=z1"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;: "In the early years of his political career, Rick Perry began hosting fellow lawmakers, friends and supporters at his family's secluded West Texas hunting camp, a place known by the name painted in block letters across a large, flat rock standing upright at its gated entrance. 'Niggerhead,' it read."&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 

"Ranchers who once grazed cattle on the 1,070-acre parcel on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River called it by that name well before Perry and his father, Ray, began hunting there in the early 1980s... But the name of this particular parcel did not change for years after it became associated with Rick Perry, first as a private citizen, then as a state official and finally as Texas governor... As recently as this summer, the slablike rock -- lying flat, the name still faintly visible beneath a coat of white paint -- remained by the gated entrance to the camp."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PoliticalWire/~4/gGsH9xw9qS0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Still Very Close in Virginia</title>
            <description>A new &lt;a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_senate_elections/virginia/election_2012_virginia_senate"&gt;Rasmussen survey&lt;/a&gt; in Virgina finds the U.S. Senate race is a statistical dead heat with 
Tim Kaine (D) barely ahead of George Allen (R), 46% to 45%.
