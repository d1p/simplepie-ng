[Atom 0.3](http://web.archive.org/web/20060811235523/http://www.mnot.net/drafts/draft-nottingham-atom-format-02.html) was brand-spanking-new. [PHP 4.3](http://php.net/archive/2004.php) was the latest release. [HTTP 1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) was only 5 years old, and [XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210) was only 6.

Windows XP was a couple of years old and [Longhorn development had just been reset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Windows_Vista#Mid-2004_to_Mid-2005:_Development_.22reset.22). My PowerBook G4 ran [Mac OS X 10.3 “Panther”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther#/media/File:AM_MacOSX_Panther.png).
