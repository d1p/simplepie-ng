**SimplePie NG** is a modern, _next-generation_ PHP package for working with syndication feeds. It has been written from the ground-up to take advantage of the modern features of PHP 7.2+.

It starts with a completely different kind of thinking, and more than 15 years of experience in software engineering and open-source. It is written with a view of PHP from today and beyond, and is being built in such a way that greater community involvement should be far easier from much earlier in the project's life.

See the [Documentation](https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng/wiki) or the [API Reference](https://simplepie.github.io/simplepie-ng/).

## Coding Standards

PSR-1/2/12 are a solid foundation, but are not an entire coding style by themselves. By leveraging tools such as [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org) and [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer), we can automate a large part of our style requirements. The things that we cannot yet automate are documented here:

## Please Support or Sponsor Development

SimplePie NG is a labor of love. I have been working on it in my free time since June 2017 because it's a project I love, and I believe our community would benefit from this tool.

If you use SimplePie NG — especially to make money — it would be swell if you could kick down a few bucks. As the project grows, and we start leveraging more services and architecture, it would be great if it didn't all need to come out of my pocket.

You can also sponsor the development of a particular feature. If there's a feature that you want to see implemented, and I believe it's the right fit for SimplePie NG, you can sponsor the development of the feature to get it prioritized.

Your contributions are greatly and sincerely appreciated.
